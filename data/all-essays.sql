It alow people, as well as animals, to notice if there is any hezerds nearby. It is also an important scence for communting with other people. Due to loud noisey modern factories, meachines, airplanes, and automobiles, a new harmful issue has created what is now known for sound pollution. Becuase of the harmful impacts of the sound pollution, people should work together to elimnate lound voices using several ways.\n	Sound pollution is produced in many parts of any comuunity. Indvisials, companies, and the govrnement are affected negitivly by the production of sound pollution. It may be thought that sound pollution affect the hearing system in the body only, but sound pollution damage several other systems. David Fisher, in his article, listed sevreal negitve impacts that damages many body parts of the people who live in a factory inviroment. He first reported the sound polluition effects on the ability to hear for the injured victims, who may work or live near a loud factory. Sound pollution reduceses hearing ability while it can make the victim hear unreal confussing sound, and the degree of affectivness is relevent to the amount of time that the victim listen to loud sound. He states that 90dB, which is usually made by a car enginee, can damage the hearing significantly of the ear listen to that loud viose constantly. He said that any sonud that is heigher that 120dB can have a dangrous damege that sometime can not be solved. Fisher detirmains that sound pollution affects harmfully body moscules, brain, and the heart. It also reduces the ability to work and product and it also decrease the quality of the work that is done by the noise pollution victim. If sound pollution was not treated proparly, it can kills, losses the ability to hear, and damage the mental of the listening victim (27-28). There are other issues for sound pollution other than what Fisher had reported.\n	The issues of the sound pollution can be also inferred by the manner of the listeners. James Berlin reported a problem with a bus company that produce noise pollution to the nearby residents who suffer from the sound duiring all day (B8). This bus station can damage the peoples life. For insteance, it can make the people shout just to talk to each other becuase if the speak quitly they will can not hear each other. It also can reduce the peoples reaction to loud noises so they will not notice if an emergancy alart accours. Some people can not even sleep if there is a lot of noise, or if they sleep, they will not feel comfortable while sleeping. \n	To get rid of the negitive impacts of the sound pollution, empployyes in industrial factories should be forced to wear ear protection even if they do not want to. The sound of the machines should be reduced as much as possible even if it costs a lot. Industrial factories should be placed far a way from living places. The govrment should not allow any factory to oberate near houses by strong laws. Furthermore, factories sound polluition should not exceced 150dB. However, indivisuals should also help in reducing sound polluition. People should not raise music and songs volume too much. They should not make noisy horns by their cars or damage their neighbours with a loud modified car engine. They should be more paishent on roads and do not horn everytime they upset. On the other hand, the govrment should make very strict laws that prohibit any loud noise. \n	If all of the community worked together to eliminate the sound polluiton, the resulats will be significant. People will found a more relaxed and quit enviroment which can make them more creative and relaxed. Most of the problems between neighbours will be avoided becuase each one of them will have the ability to sleep easliy.  For instance, people who need to be consintreated while working, such as writiers, designers, editors, and painters will be more productive and efficiant becuase they will have a better and quiter work enviroment.\n	Overall, sound pollution is a problem that is made by humankind. It has a negitive influance in the peoblem themselves so they should work together in order to reduce its negitive impacts. It will benefits most of the people in having better, more relaxed, benefica', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '10.5', 0, ''),

It has sparked debate because some people say they are not disturbed by it, while others express no tolerance toward it. In the same context, some people enjoy listening to loud music in their car. Quite to the contrary, other people feel angry by such an attitude. There is a significant difference between a low sound and a loud sound by the feeling it provokes. After listening to a loud noise, even for a few minutes,  it can be overwhelming. David Fisher in "Noise Polution" decribes the consequences of being exposed to loud noise and urges the sound engineers to decrease it.  People should work to eliminate noise pollution because noise pollution can have serious health effects and we should definitely stand for our rights to live quietly.\r\n	First, noise pollution can affect the health negatively. Exposure to loud noise can damage the hearing. Longtime exposure to loud noise in the industry impact workers'' hearing (Fisher 27-28). The power of sound of loud noise will change the struture of the inner part of the ear and make the listeners more likely to suffer from hearing loss. Moreover, excessive loud noise can alter our mental health. Lack of sleep at night due to noise pollution can make people irascible and undermine their ability to speak effectively (27-28). Some individuals get angry easily because their sleep has been stopped by the loud noise and tend to become isolated. Therefore, people should attempt to avoid those negative effects by banning noise pollution.\r\n	Second, It is up to us to stand for our rights. Anyone deserves the right to live in a quiet environment. James Berlin in "Most County Vows to Crack Down on Noise Pollution At Ride On Depot" reports that loud noise can be heard at night and in the morning. This will disturb the neighbors who are sleeping and impact their lives. Just take a few seconds to imagine your are with your family while a noisy sound appears. Furthermore, authorities should take the proper measures by enforcing the laws and make sure people stick to them. It is forbidden in our policy that the buses are running for more than 3 minutes (Berlin). The buses must not let the engines work for a certain time because their sound will annoy the neighboorhood. In fact, the reality is far from what suposed to be done. Berlin relates authorities, while under pressure, gives the impression they will take the steps, but give up on their responsibility later. Consequently, the residents living in those areas disturbing by noise pollution should give voice to their opinions by protesting, taking the streets in order to make the authorities respect their rights. Any kind of noise pollution should be eliminated.\r\n	 Some people may take issue with the idea of avoiding all kind of noise pollution. They might say not all kind of noise pollution are harmful since Fisher suggests only the exposure to sound over 90 dB may damage hear and devices such as earplugs can be used to avoid it. Although some devices may be used to protect our ears, we should fight against noise pollution to prevent it by banning all activities that promote loud sound. Prevention is the key and some damage may be irreversible to the ear. People should be commited to helping eliminate noise pollution and create a peaceful environment for everyone.\r\n       After all, people should work to eliminate noise pollution due to its dangerous effects to our health and the disturbing environment it creates. Noise pollution can also impair our psychological ability by making us isolated and altering the mood. People''s goal should make all eff\r\n                                                                     	', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.5', '13.5', 0, ''),

That anwser did not come from my personal prefrences or interests, but it came after the continuous suffering from the boisturous train that passes everday nearby my apartment. Noise polution, in my opinion, should be reduced to the minimum or even inhilated because exposure to a high level of sound will cause a temporary or permanent ear damage, reduces people ability for production, and finally, frets people and causes a mental and "psychological" issues.\r\n       \r\n        Firstly, exposuring to high levels of sound can be a risky task if someone trying to do so. Recent studys have shown that exposure to high sound level with a high noise density can cause a serious damge to the internal ear and that damage can be temporary or permanent depending on the length of time and sound intensity. For instance, "exposure to noise in excess of 90 dB for eight hours in any twenty-four hours for five days a week can lead to permanent hearing damage if exposure continues over a period of thirty to forty years"(David Fisher, 27) . So the seriousity of the noise should be taken in consideration, especially for the workers who are working in a loud and noisy environment like airports and train stations. Additionally, laws and amends should be legislated in order to obligate companies to protect their workers from lossing their hearing or to avoid other issues produced by noise.\r\n\r\n        Secondly, other effects resulting from exposure to high sound levels are related with physical and health issues. People "productivity and efficiency" will be signficantly affected by the high levels of sound. Moreover, people errors will increased if they are working in a loud and noisy environment. Clearly, reduced people productivity and efficiency resulted from physical and mental stress generated from noise and loud sounds because it leads to the difficulty to concentrate in doing the work. In addition to that, companies should not look just for the worker productivity but also the should take worker safety in consideration because physical and mental stress when it causes errors. Such errors can cause accidents to the lives and properties which also leading to big loss for the companies.         \r\n      \r\n          Finally, debates may be presence, when such people consider noise and loud sounds may become one of the psycological and self issues. However, such debate and odds clearly comes from those people who like to listen to the loud music like rock music, so they find it interested to hearing the loud sounds. On the contrary those who oppose such intersets find that loud sounds even if they are music sound can cause a mental and self issues to the people. For me, as my personal experience with the trains sounds bad and hopes not to repeate in the future, for sure, I find that exposure to high sound levels causes self issues such as anger, continuous complaints even for the tiny things, and the false judging to some personal situations. For example, in an investigation by Washington News, Traffic and Weather (WTOP), endeavors to reduce the noise caused by buses are still continuing, on the other hand, people still complains from the noise and loud sounds (James Berlin, B8). Its clear that people have taken a situation from such boisterious buses so they refuse any efforts to help them from getting rid of the noise.\r\n\r\n           To summerize, noise pollution is becoming a serious problem to the people everday life. People are suffering from this recent issue, where it has bad consequences on the people lives and their physical, psychological, and mental health. Steps should be taken and soultions should be put in order to find a conveinent solution for the noise environment. Such solutions should not be temporary, but they should be permanent and suitable to each type of noise and loud sounds. \r\n        \r\n    \r\n \r\n', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '11.5', 0, ''),
(288, '2014-07-21', 600015742, 2014, 3, 'b', 'Noise Pollution \r\n\r\n	In today''s world all places are srounded by machines (industries production machine, buses, trains, cars and etc.) that are so loud and distrubing. Noise pollution is becoming more problemitic with increase of factories plants near people''s living area. David Fisher in his article titled "Noise Pollution" well pointed out that people are affected by industrial noise pollution in different ways. Specially industrial plants which are built near people''s residential areas (without their consent) causes annoyance for people of that area (Fisher, 27-28). To control and reduce adverse pyschological and physical effects of noise pollution people should file complain against industries that built their plants near the residential areas, ensuer noise control legislation implementation as a safety measures for the workers of industries and reduce/control of the idle buses movement.\r\n\r\n	People should file complaint against the industries that built their plants near the residential areas without considering people''s consent.  Because noise pollution can have many negative pyschological effects including but not limitted to creating of  disturbance for sleep, focus and brain productivity. Fisher in the "Noise Pollution" article explains some negative pyschological effects of noise pollution which include irritation and tension that''s caused by "interruption of sleep by noise" as well as inefficiency and  reduction in productivity (27-28). So to control the noise pollution people should take step and complain about such industries for the safety of their communities.\r\n\r\n	Noise pollution can cause serious physical damage as fisher explains in his article about few physical damage that noise pollution causes including hearing losses and rate of breathing and heart problems (27-28). It is very important to control the serious damage noise pollution can make by close suppervion on the implimentation of legislation on noise control. The industries should take some measures for controling the physical negative effects of noise on their worker by providing the worker with proper facilities and medical check-up to make sure their saftey is not over looked.\r\n\r\n	The other way to control noise pollution is to decrease movement of idle buses around the city and people have been complaing for two decades about the "round-the-clock noise from the buses" as reported by James Berlin in his article called "Mont County Vows to Crack Down on Noise Pollution at Ride on Depot" (Berlin). The bus drivers should trun off the motors of the buses while idle. The buses system should be controled by an on call system specially during the night when there are less movement of people to ensure reduced noise pollution.\r\n\r\n	In order to have a society free of noise pollution and reduce negative pychological and phyiscal effects of loud noise it is very important that poeple take part and complain about the industries which are not considered of the noise standards and create noise pollution near the residential areas. The idle buses movement need to be controlled in order to decrease noise pollution in different communities for people''s well being. In order to ensure both the noise control legislation implimentation needs to be ensured.\r\n	', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.5', '2.5', '12.5', 0, ''),

With this the advance of techology, many areas of studying, such Medicine, Engineering, Social Communication and others, have been developing significantly, which is very good for development of the society as well as the well being of the human kind. However, negative effects, such as liquid pollution, atmosferic pollution, noise pollution, less interaction of people personally, development of harmful explosives, and others, of this development have been noticed. Particularly, noise pollution is a serious problem that deserves the attention of the society in general. Noise polluition disturbes people''s well being, such health, social confort,  good sleeling, etc. To prevent these problems from occuring, people should work to eliminate noise pollution in their communities because noise pollution is harmful to people''s healthness, and it cause soicial disturbance.\r\n	One of the the negative efects of  noise pollution is that it cause health problems. Actually, experts show that noise pollution cause bad functions of the human being organ systems, such as hearing system, respiratory system, circulatory system and others. As evidence, the article "Noise Pollution," about the effects of noise pollution provides some of these health problems caused by noise pollution. In this article, David Fisher argues that noise pollution causes hearing loss, alteration of the electrical activity of the brain, heart, breath rates and others. Here, it is shown that if noise pollution is not reduced, many people will have problems in their body functions. In addition, noise pollution cause psycological disturbance, such as irritability, resentness and others, to the human kind. According to Fisher, pollution noise interrupts people''s sleep, which results in people becoming tense, resentful and etc. Fisher adds that besides preventing people from sleeping, noise pollution cause mental illness. It means, if nothing is done to minimizate noise pollution, the society will have many suffering from mental disturbance, which will cause other health problems because experts belive affirm that the brain controls every function of the human being. Therefore, if the brain is not nworking properly, other organs will not work properly as well, which migh result in many different health problems.\r\n	Another negative effect of noise pollution is social disturbance.  Noise pollution prevent people from sleepin and cause disconfort. Many people fell disturbed when they hear noise above the limit of the noise with which they fell confortable, which many times results in loss of sleep. The article "Mont County Vows to Crack Down on Noise Pollution at Ride on Depot," a report on the effects of noise pollution, shows the disconfort of some people concering noise p[ollution. In this article, James Berlin reports that Mounty County officials decide to crack down noise pollution of buse after many people complained about this noise. Accoprding to Berlin, on of the resindents showed their disconfort when they say that they can unfortunately hear that noise during rthe night and the early morning. Berlin adds that some residents affirmed that they have been complaining about this noise for two decades. Here, it shown once again that noise pollution takes out people''s social confort. This problem has been also noticed in many African countries and others countries in other continents where people organize parties outdoors with very loud music. Many of the parties parties interrupts people''s sleep because they are too noise. In England, for example, a man was jailed because the noise caused by his truck while digging outside of his house prevent him from sleeping. In this example, it is very clear that that noise disturbed other people who live near by him, preventing them from sleeping as well. So, everyone should work to minimize or even eliminate this proble, noise polluition, that disturbs many people around the world.\r\n	In conclusion, noise pollution is harmful to the well being of the human kind. This issue cause health and social problems among people. Loss of hearing, mental illness, alteration of the human body functions, interruption of sleep and other problems are pointed out as the main problems resulting from noise pollution. Social disconfort, such as lacking of sleep, that result from noise pollution make many people to fell disconfortable and in and make people to complain. Concerning this issue, some people are put in jail to avoid noise pollution from occuring. To minimize this issue, people should respect the limits of noise while working or having a party. Creating Engineering machines that make less noise than the current ones is one of the things thjat can help minimize the current rates of noise pollution.', '00:00:00', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '10.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '14.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.50', '2.50', '2.25', '2.50', '2.50', '12.25', '2.5', '2.5', '2.3', '2.5', '2.5', '12.3', 0, ''),

It is a common sense that we try not to bother other people so that we make a good relationship with other people. However, it is inconspicuous when people feel bothered. So, what is the most annoying thing that disturb one''s peace and ruin our realationship? Here I belive that making so loud noise that people living aroud us get to hear can be very annoying and contribute to make people hate us.  i am sure that many people have been suffered from hearing loud noise, especially when they try to do some important work. In fact not only does neghibor make loud noise but construction and  train or anything else as well. In order to solve this issue, we should recognize the reason why people do not like to hear loud noise and what we should do to get rid of this problem. \r\n\r\nFirst, there are some hazardous effect on one''s condition phisically and psychologically  by hearing annoying loud noise. For example, it is very stressful when you are sleeping, you are awaken by noise from the train at mid night. This is the situation that often happes to me, and it is hard to fall a sleep again because of the big frustration of noise that interupt my sleep. According to David Fisher, a professer of Oxford University, "Interruption of sleep by noise can cause people to becaome tense, irritable, and resentful about the cause of the noise, especially if they are convinced that the noise is avoidable." Further more, big noise also can influence on one''s health. David Fisher states " Other effects include changes in itegral body functions, such as the electrical activity of the brain, heart and breathing rates, and muscle mobility." It has scientifically proved that hearing loud noise can effect on not only meatally but also phisically one''s body function, and it is unreasonable that people get those negative effects by loud noise because of people who do not care about otgher people.\r\n\r\nIn addition, people should at least do some effort to reduce noise as much as they can. . In the reallity, there are many companies that conduct construction or run the train nomatter what time it is. Because of that, many people are suffered from hearing the big sound by them. In the article, written by James Berin, the company, Mont County officials, promised that they idle their buses because many residents living nearby there complaint about the noise that their buses make for a long time. Some times they need to compromise to solve the noise pollution and it can not be helped that companies try to do their work efficiently even though the work makes loud noise. However, a lot of people are intolerable that they hear annoying noise many times. So, it is important that companies try to make less sound even though that is not beneficial for them. \r\n\r\nConsequently, people can get annoyed and frustrated by hearing a loud noise and it is a current issue that people harm other people by making big sound. As a matter of fact, hearing loud noise can certainly effect on not only people''s mental but phisical.

Many people complain about the noises that come for work places in their neighborhoods that prevent tham from sleep and annoy them while they are at home. People think these noises can''t be avoided and they must be eliminated; however, some noises come from workplaces, factories, busses, and train stations and eliminating them will cause a econamic loss for these compnies. People should work to get rid of these noise pollution because they cause a very harmful hearing problems, also affect people''s bodies, and these noises should be eliminated from nieghborhoods. \r\n	First, pollution noises cause hearing problems to people. Loud noises during the day and night are not good things that the ear could accept, loud noises can damage and harm people''s ear. According to the article " Noise Pollution," the author Daivid Fisher explains how noise pollution affects people and how it can affect the ear. David Fisher claims that noise pollution "temporarily" decreases the ability to hear and people may start to hear buzzing and ringing inside their ears. Fisher says reports that "exposure to noise in excess of 90 dB," "dicibel" which is meassring " the power of sound" for eight hours on a day for complete five days can cause a "permanent" hearing problems for almost thirty to forty days. Thus, hearing noise during the day and night can damage people''s ear "temporarily" and some of them can be"permanent".  People should work to get rid of it from the neihborhoods to avoid this serious problem which is very dangrous for people espcially children and old people.  \r\n	Moreover, noise pollution can be dangerous for human''s body and it can affect thier health. these noises are not just harmful for people''s ear; moreover, it affects the the people''s body and may cause some diseases and illnesses. Fisher reports that noise pollution affects the brain, heart, the breath, and also "muscle mobility." Some researches did an experiment in animals and they noticed that there are changings in blood pressure and so many negetivally changings such as "anxiety deviation in sleep petterns, and reduction of appetite" (Fisher,27-28). After all, noise pollution can affect people''s entire body and it might cause some diseases. The problem is that people are in their house and they are recieving diseases and effects without doing anything; moreover, people should start working in this problem to avoid harming innocent people. \r\n	In addition, noise pollution has to be eliminated from all neiborhoods espically that have children. If this problem faced the children, it might be a big problem because they might have a "permanent" hearing probem for almost thirty to forty years of their age and thats a serious problem (Fisher.27-28). Noone woud like to grow up with some hearing problems because human''s ear is one of the most important part of body that make people live a regular life. futhermore, some people come  back home from work tired and want to relax, but these noises couldn''t make relax, or sleep and they don''t feel comfortable even in their own houses. In the article "Mont County Vows To Crack Down On Noise Pollution At Ride On Depot," the author James Berlin explain a noisy busses that come across a specific neiborhood and how people are annoyed from them. James, Berlin claims that some people have complained for twenty years about "round-the-clock noise from the busses" and some people claims that '' they can hear them at night and the morning.'' Thus, these noises cause so many problems to everyone and people should start working to get rid of them from the neigborhoods.\r\n	In conclusion, these noises cant be in a neighborhood that have people to make them feel comfortable in their own houses. eliminatiing noise pollution from the communities is a good idea becuase it cause people hearing problems, and affects people''s health and neiborhoods should not have these noises. if noises people eliminated noise pollutuion, everyone would be comfortable resident people and also the the workplaces because people would have peace and no noises and workers would work without any interruption and no complains.

So, sound is an essential part of our life. However, everything has a certain limits which is an impotent factor for using  that energy. Therefore, using sound loudly is called noise. Our body is a big scientific machine where every parts are arrranging  with  consistent ways. Moreover, in our society allthings are correlated with each other. From our everyday life to environmental''s lives and our whole productions systems are depending on different energy level, and different application level. So, here, from several reports we can say that making noise has severla bad effects, such as, hearing loss and mental illness, reduction of productivity, and interupting the other living entities. So,  here we will do the comparative study with respect to different news and articles about the noise effects.\r\nSo, first is hearing loss and mental illness which is very impotent issue nowadays. Because, form several scientific analysis and global analysis we have that by wroking in  high  noise level environment, many people lost their hearing power as well as becoming mental ill. According to David fisher in his article "Noise pollution"  , we have, "Indutrial noise causes actual damage to hearing of labores who suffer overexposure to loud sounds in the workplace.".(Fisher. 27-28).  So, we have some certain limit for absorbing the noise from our environment. For example, scientifically the limit is 90 decibel(DB). Working in the environment which is more than this limit , according to  David Fisher for working five days for eight hours  and for thirty to forty years, peole permenently lost their hearing power.(Fisher). Also, according to Fisher that any body works of 150 DB noise level will damage their ear permanently. So , in this situation we are violating the limit of noise every time by fire working, industrial revolutions, and transportation service. Fiisher also says in his article,"Interruption of sleep by noise can cause people to become tense, irritable and resentful about the cause of the noise,." ( Fisher). So, the main thing is that we must control our sound pollution as early as possible, however, our highly civilized society could not maintain this rules. So, for better solution is that for living peacefully we should follow the rule of nature.\r\n\r\nThe second thing is reduction of productivity which is impotent issue for modern life. For example, if we are working in a noisy environment, we can not sleep properly. As a result, we could not give our effort properly. So, in this situation the production of industries will reduce day by day. We can also observe this situation in field of education, when we have noisy environment we could not concentrate our mind properly, therefor, we take a lot of time for learning a simple topic. So we have several problems for our noisefull environment. According to David fisher  in  his paper said " In several tests, it has been established that productivity and efficiency can be seriously affected by high noise levels,". Same time there is a big effect of  high noise level in our body system. Here,Fisher in his article says " other effect include changes in integral body function such as the electric activity of our brain, heart and breathing rates, and muscle mobility.".(Fisher). So the high noise level affects our life different ways.\r\n\r\nThird is interuptions of other living entities which is another impotent issue. For Increasing world population , we need to increase the transpotation system as well as bulding and constructions. So, day by day the public buses and cars are increasing. As a reasult , we should make more parking places as well as bus depo. At the place of bus depo and praking place, we have lot of noise. As a result ,we are disturbing other spcies around us. We are destroying their nest of birds and other animals''living place. Near the depo or parking place people could not sleep well and could not work well. According to report Wasington post by James Berlin says  about Mongomery County Divisiopn  that the people could not sleep well near the bus depo as well as where the bus should wait for three minutes, but they are waiting for half an hour sometime and making the high noise sound.(Berlin). So in this way we are all time destroying our environment and other lives.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion,  we  can say  that if we are not control the noise level , we will suffer a lot of problems such as we lost our hearing capability, mental illness will increase, reductivity of productions and destroying other lives. So we should take immidate steps to control the sound pollution by making strict rules and regulations. every 	people should be carefull about using the sound system. otherwise we  canb lost our life and peace full environment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorks cited:\r\n1.

Some people believe that noise pollution should be taken meaasure on our lives because noise pollution has varies impacts on human well being in their physical. Some people claim that we should pay attention to our mental healthy because it will not decrease the stresses in our family and workplace. In addition, facing the noice pollution , we should deal with it through logical methods, because noise pollution has badly affected on people''s physical, like hering loss,and psychological,such as: districting thier mind and feeling upset . \r\n	on the one hand, noise pollution causes series of health problems in our physical. We live in the environment that is filled with noise. The products influence deeply us on the lifestyle. When entering house in modern social, we find lots of electrocity products putting on our bedroom, kichen, living room and so on. Even though we want to get away from the noise plcaces to another peace. Some people think that techology can improve our quality of our life, which cannot lead our hearing to be deaf. Everyone uses the phone to watch movie and listen to music, which is not the matter of our physical. Overmore, as David said , entitled  "   Noice Pollution" ,  " Exposure to noise in excess of 90 dB for eight hours in any twenty-four hours for five days a week can lead to permanent hearing damage if exposure continues over a period of thirty to forty years." Therefore, a little bit noices is not bad tyo our physical but it is harmful on the long term. Such a terrible surrounding, what should we do? The question is unavoidable. The best way is to go away from the resources of noise pollution. And people intend to find a peace and quiet place to enjoy youselves.\r\n	on the other hand, the noise pollution districts people''s concentation so that people in the workplace have tense emotion for friends and their family members. We always busy working for eight or ten hours so we want to  have a good sleep at night. This is simple thing in our daily life. However, what will be happening? Sometimes your neighbors host a grant party at whole night, which is full of the sound of music and the communication of people. At the same time, the alarm of the train going through rings near your house.  As the result of the issues, people could not have enough time to sleep well. When they go to work, many mistakes will be made. As we know, empioyees working for industry bear heavy stresses.Although they are likely to do their tasks in a good condition, their mental can influence the effeciency  because of the noise pollution. Solving the problem caused by noise pollution is more important than to complaint other people. In order to prevent peopel from noise pollution, people should find a good situation to live. If your neighbors produce noice pollution. you had better give them suggestion. The companies offer consultations with doctors for hearing test each year and the industries provide the machinethat can reduce the noise for employees(Fisher). These ways will be good for people to work and live in relax situation.\r\n       In conclusion, the effect of noise pollution is not only caused physical problem, but also lead people to upset their work and lives.  People who twist with noise pollution manage to seek a reasonable method to change the pressure into a strength. Even short periods of exposure have not evident effect on people'' physical and psychological, noice pollution is still working. People should gain the attention to solutions dealing with the noise pollution. People should devote their whole lives to working to decline noise pollution.', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.0', '1.0', '2.0', '1.5', '8.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '1.5', '9.5', '2.00', '2.00', '1.50', '2.00', '1.50', '9.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

There is no doubt that pullotion is one of the most serious issues that people all around the world have suffured from. A lot of countries are doing such a great job to eliminate this chronic problem by creating some alternatives that help people to reduce and get ride of this problem. It does not just affect people''s life, but it can also affect other animals and plants. Hence, there are many negative impacts noise pullotin creates such as health problems and outside damages and furtunately there are many active actions people can do to eliminate noise pullotion.\r\n              Regrettably, pullotion has become an obstacle a lot of people get hurt because of it. It is clear that pollution creates many negative effects in this wordly life. According to David Fisher, pollution creates many health problems like changes in integral body functions which negativaly affect other inside members like brain, heart, breathing rates, and muscle mobility (27-28). He adds that it can also change the size of gland and affect blood pressure. Disappointedly, it does not just affect people, but it also strongly affects animals by reducing appetite sense and that for sure will affect other senses ( David Fisher 27-28). Additionally, there are other negative affects pollution creates such as outside damages. In other words, it causes annoyance to neighbors, especially where industrial plants are built. Consequently, it causes many problems to the hearing of laborers. There is another issue James Berlin discusses in his article. According to Berlin, some residents are complaining about round the clock noise that buses make. This one should not be allowed to be idled for more than three minutes because it disturbs other people by making some noise and that unfortunately will not give the chance for people to take rest smoothly (B8). He adds that this problem will be common in the local communities if people do not follow the established operating standards. n addition to that, some drivers do not care whether buses remain turn on for long time or not (B8). Evantually, noise pollution needs to be controlled because if does not, it will keep causing many severe problems in the future.\r\n              Far away from the neggative effects pollution creates, there are many active actions people can properly do to eliminate pollution and it''s neggative impacts. David Fisher demonstrates this crucial point in his article by saing that many companies can offer some devices for emplyees to wear, which help them reducing the level of noise such as foam earplugs and passive headsets (27-28). He also adds that there are active headsets available, which work on reducing out additional noise. Moreover, companies can also give the chance for their workers to annually hearing tests with doctors. Fisher also suggests the best way to reduce noise damage is to dispose as much noise as possible and this mission can be easily done by sound engineers (27-28). Besides, James Berlin strongly confirms that county officials should put their drivers under quit surviellance to make sure drivers are following the rules that indicate buses should be turn off before the three times limit. In the article," Mont County Vows to crack down on noise pollution at Ride On depot," James Berlin emphasizes that " The noise is three times the Environmental Protection Agency''s limit." Hypothetically, if people had followed these important structions indicated above, they would have reduced and eliminated pollution. Indeed, these important solutions are fruitful and they will certainly pay off. \r\n                In my opinion, there are other proper solutions people can follow to eliminate pollution. For instance, government should be working on putting some strict laws that enforce people not to through out everything but in the specialist places they are supposed to. Additionally, government should give some advise to residents to guide them to the right way and make them intellectual and aware of neggative impacts pollution creates. \r\n                In sum, pollution is a serious topic every single person should be aware of because of the neggative effects it can creat like health problems and outside damages. In addition, there are many solutions people can do to eliminate this problem.

(298, '2014-07-21', 600014041, 2014, 3, 'b', ' There are some important effects of noise pollution. According to David Fisher, the author of the article "Noise Pollution",  when people hear noise positively for example, listening to heavy metal music, they can enjoy the noise at that moment; however, when people hear the noise passively, for example road constructions, the noise should effect negatively. From this aspect, people should eliminate noise pollution. Actually, there are several ways that people can take to reduce noise pollution in their communities.\r\n First, it is needless to say, noise pollution will cause people''s inner ear damage(Fisher). For example, if people live near airports or manmos train stations, they might suffer noise pollution continuesly. To protect these people, goverments or the traffic companies should take action. Instaling double windows or shutters to the residents is alredy done in many areas. If the price of properties near such noisy sights is lower than the quiet places, peole who settle thier houses there might accept noise pollution and barely complain for it. At the same time, this is not the issue of the residents who hear the noise passively. The people who work at the sight where noise happen, also suffer same kind of damages. To protect these people, employer should provide tools for example, earplugs and passive headsets(Fisher). In addition, residents and workers should think where to live or where to work seriously before they suffer noise pollution.\r\n Second, noise pollution may also cause damages to other body functions. If people hear the noise to a certain amount of time, some changes will happen in the electrical activity of the brain, heart and breath rates(Fisher). Compare to inner ear damage, these damages on brain, heart or breathing are more serious and definately cause death to people.  Although these damages have been inspected only on animal experiments(Fisher), medical treatments should be developped promptely to cure the people who have posibility to suffer noise pollution on their body functions.\r\n  Furthermore, noise can cause damge to people mentally. For example, when people lack of sleep because of noise at night, the changes may happen on their daily lives. Noise effects on people''s productivity and efficiency and when noise is reduced, the mistakes or errors are reduced(Fisher). From these reasons, noise pollution should be eliminated. When people can not avoid noise pollution, people and noise maker should complete some kind of agreements. According to James Berlin, the author of the article "Mont County Vowes to Crack Down on Noise Pollution at Ride On Depot", there is a rule theree-minute limit of idling of the buses. Think about the needness and publicity of buses, the residents of bus depo can not avoid noise cpmpletely. To keep the mutual benefits, there must be some agrremnets between residents and noise makers.\r\n To sum up, if noise pollution occurs continuesly, there are apparently more negative effects than possitive one on people. Negative effects may cause not only serious damages to people but also cause death to them. To avoid such situation, peole should take some actions to acquire the comfortable lives and noise maker also should take some actions to complete their jobs and protect the people at the same time.

In fact, machines have changed the world. As we learnt from the story, the industrial revolution was the key to the development of the world. However, these machines that help humans a lot, can make noise pollution. In addition, because some people are exposed to noise polluition, it can be harmful to them. In order to eliminate noise polluition in their communities, people should take some actions such as, creating methods that permit to reduce some noise pollution, and the government should punish the companies which make some noise above the limits by law.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it should be created methods that permit to reduce noise pollution. According to Fisher David, while some people like to listen music too loud, others disapprove it. They may disapprove it since being exposed to noise pollution can cause not only hearing damage, but also some body problems. David explains that the time and the level noise are two fundamental elements which define the kind of the hearing problem that someone can take. For example, people who are exposed  to some noise, they will take between short hearing damage and permanent hearing damage according to the level and time of the exposure. in addition, the noise pollution has negative effects in human body. As David reports, some problems such  a "Fatigue, anxiety, deviations in sleep patterns, and reduction of the apptite that have been noted in animals tests," probably may happen to humans when they are esposed to some noise. When someone is listen music or watching television, he cannot listen louder because it would not only be harmful to him, but also it would be harmful to his neighborhood. Moreover, Because machines make noise, all machines that work in urban areas should have the limit from noise pollution. I mean, the driver should be forced to follow the stright rules against machinies noise pollution. For example, Berlin James reports that some residents from the leafy neighborhood are worried about the extensive noise that buses have made between night untill early in the morning. Thus, it is very important that the drivers follow the rules in order to reduce noise pollution in people community.\r\n\r\nNextly, in order to reduce noise pollution, the government should punish the companies which have made noise pollution above the limits regulated by law. james explains in his article, explains that the noise in the leafy neibhborhood is above the limit regulated by law. Machines such vessels, pumps, cars, airplaine, and so on make noise, and people who work in places with noise pollution can be negatively affected by it. Thus, the government should force the companies to give wear devices to their employees in order to keep them health. These equipments are very important because they can reduce noise. In addition, companies shoud send their employees the time by time to see a Doctor. This process will not only guarrantee the employees safety, but also will bring more productivity and efficiency  from employees. On the other hand, to companies that do not follow the rules, they must be closed.\r\n\r\nThus, in order to eliminate noise pollution in their communities people should take some actions such as creating methods that permit to reduce some noise pollution, and the government should punish the companies which make some noise above the limits by law.

From short-term hearing problem to life-threatening conditions, and people should work together to alleviate dangers posed by the loud noise. In fact, people can cooperate among themselves and take collective and individual actions to reduce noise pollution in their communities.\r\n\r\n	Noise pollution is harmful to health, and can affect both physical wellbeing and mental health of a person. As article "Noise Pollution" written by David Fisher points out that if long-term exposure to loud noise continues, permanent damage might be inflicted to hearing ability of a person. Indeed, working on both levels can dramatically prevent numerous health problems. For example, exposure to noise in excess of 90 dB  for eight hours in 24 hours for five days in week can pose a potential damage to hearing ability, and if it conitues for thirty or fourty years it perhaps leads to permanent hearing loss. (Fisher). Health dangers of noise pollution is not limited to hearing. They can also have detrimental effects on integral body functions like electical activity of the brain, heart and respiratory organs, and muscular activity. (Fisher). Additionally, mental health of a person can be put at risk if people do not pay attention to noise pollution. Those psychological problems may comprise various conditions such as sleep disturbances, impaired speech communication, feeling of isolation, and more seriously accidents. (Fisher). Therefore, people can take number of measures to tackle this problem. On individual level, they should use all those devices like headsets and earplugs which help reduce the damage that could be caused by noise pollution. People can also routinely check their hearing status through their healthcare provider which can undoubtedly decrease hearing damage inflicted by noise pollution.\r\n\r\n	As noise pollution poses a great threat to health status of people, they should take part in public health programs and community-based interventions to reduce aforementioned hazards. Public health programs are designed to prevent health problems before their actual occurrance so it will help engage communities in their health programs. They can also do advocay through their political representatives to amend laws that endangers labors'' health. Labor unions play pavitol role in this because noise pollution, which causes health problems, decreased productivity or a worker, and can potentially affect efficiency, so it is significant to bring changes in the law or put pressure on legislators to consider such issues when they formulate new laws and regulations. It is aslo of utmost importance to enforce laws that prevent noise pollution. For example, officials in Mont County in Britain cracked down on buses which were disturbing local people with their idling Ride on buses, and no doubt, enforcing regulation of buses will prevent noise pollution and ultimately health problems. (Jamses Berlin)\r\n\r\nIn summary, noise pollution is a great public health concern. It needs to be thoroughly taken into consideration, and requires multi-dimentional approach. Prevention is better than cure, and noise pollution can be tackeled through rigorous prevention programs as pointed out earlier. Governments, labors unions, civil society, and people in general have collective responsiblity to fight this problem and addressing it in every platform.\r\n\r\n	1- Fisher, David. "Noise Pollution."

Noise has so many harmful negative effects that derive from hearing loss, mental illness, reduced productivity to even loss of life. Scientists have been working non stop to prevent such problems from occuring, these problems usually occur in areas where people live near industrial buildings or highways in which traffic is oftenly filled up and all you could hear is car horns and people yelling. If you live in noise polluted areas you will probably wake up every morning stressed because of the noise that prevented you from sleeping on the first hand, you won''t have enough hours of sleeping and you will not be able to do your assignments or paper work for your job, as David Fisher says in his Noise Pollution article "Evidence clearly indicates that high levels of noise are harmful to human well being, and noise pollution needs to be controlled."\r\n     Undoubtedly, noise is a health hazard and because of that, you are going to have to ask an expert on how to avoid noise pollution for that this problem is medically and psychologically dangerous. Many victims of noise pollution have taken a serious act and filed complaints in court, but will that help you heal? People should stop noise pollution at first so we can avoid such negative effects from happening. For example, an article by James Berlin gives the example of Mont County people who said that they are cracking down on the noise of buses. In response, Washington News, Traffic and Weather supported the people and captured one of the rides to check on these regulations for the buses, and this led the county officials to respond and launching an investigation and has issued a statement acknowledging guilt. The moral of this story is, with all this noise, your voice will be heard. People should always work together to eliminate any kind of pollution in ntheir communities, their voice would not have been heard if they weren''t together as one community believing in what''s right. Noise pollution will reduce your productivity and that will lead to losing your job or failing your courses, so if you are facing this problem or living in noise polluted areas, take a serious act and do something about it. Living without noise and annoyance is very healthy and brings joy to your life in so many ways, leaving stress behind is the first of them.\r\n     However, noise should not be treated like it''s a good thing and cannot be used to fight with, for example, Marvel Comics, which is a company that establishes superhero comic books, has established a superhero named Banshee who has the ability to shout supersonic high waves of noise that could kill people and destroy building. Cool huh? Well, as cool as it may sound, they shoud have made him the villain due to his killing, harmful and destructive superpower. When childern read such stuff, they will scream at people all the time believing that they are Banshee, and parents clearly do not want to have headaches after a long day of working. Noise and screaming may lead you to feel isolated and reduce your confidence with talking to people due to everyone telling you to lower your voice everytime you speak, "speech communication can be inpaired by noise," says David Fisher, "resulting in inefficiency, feelings of isolation, and more seriously, accidents."\r\n     Companies are testing noise pollution on animals to see what effects it could cause them which might also cause humans, companies should reduce high noise levels for many reason, first of which, the lower the noise is the fewer chances of mistakes happening. Second, high noise levels will affect the human integral body functions, and that will reduce the number of employees working in your company. Last but not least, excessive noise levels will have inner ear damage that causes hear ringing and buzzing in your employees'' ears which will lead to many mistakes and may causes the employees affected to file a case against the owner of the company in court. So to prevent many of these prblems from occuring, get red of the source of the pollution. Or acquire employees with headphones that can protect their ears in the work feild if engineers have not come up with machines that have lower noise.\r\n     In contrast, noise is diffenetely harmful, it will affect your physical and mental health, so take all the chances of preventing it as soon as you can. Gather up as one community and stop the pollution for more productivity and a healthy life.', '00:00:00', '0.0', '1.0', '1.0', '1.0', '3.0', '6.0', '1.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '11.5', '2.0', '2.5', '2.5', '2.0', '3.0', '12.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.50', '2.75', '2.75', '2.00', '2.75', '11.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, 'peech communication can be inpaired by n'),

Those factories produce different kinds of products which help the humanity to develop and work effectively, but the brutal truth that those, who own factories, do not have much ideas about negative effects of expanding factories. one of the most important dangerous impacts of industry is noise pollution which caused by increasing the level of sounds in the environment. Many people are suffering from paucity in their hearing, and according to James, a reporter in Washington News, he reprts that many people are suffering from pollution noise especially who live nearby roads which replete with buses(James B8). Pollution noise should be reduced becasue it has negative effects in people''s heath in both aspects mentally and phsyically, and people who are in charge of being near sources of the noise they can eliminate damage effects by using modern technology. \r\n	Noise pollution should be controled because it has hazarous effects in people''s bodies. In the article " Noise Pollution, David Fisher argues that noise pollution should be eliminated because it damges the health such as reducing the ability of hearing. For example workers in factories are predisposed to face this problem. They always work with variety of machines which produce high level of sounds. In addtion, the mixmum level of sounds for humans is "90 dB( decible, which is standerd measure of the power of sounds (Fisher27). Constantly, many workers would be suffering from lacking in hearing. Therefore, their ability of hearing would be reduced less than the people who are not working in fectories. In addtion, health condition is one of the necessary issue in any community, and governments collaborating whith dfferent organizations are trying to solve this proplem by contacting with varity facories. But it seems tha the pace of reducing noise is not going forward because according to Peak, the Monty County is showing that they are concerned about that when people complain, but they do not do much to solve this problem (Berlin B8). So, noise pollution is dangerous for health, and they should be reduced.\r\n	Another concern about noise pollution is causing mental proplems such as lacking in sleep. Much noise can be major factor to make people stressed and in impured conditions. When people looked at the the cause of that, they found that high blood pressure is playing a great role in the making people mad and stressed. This effect mainly casuse by noising pollution( Fisher 27). So, people in such society need much time of quiet becsue all their day filled by works wich make them stressed. "Anxiety" and paucity in sleep manner are results of a study done by experts on animals, which have similarity humans, found some negative effecst in animals'' brains. Comparing to humans, the propencity of negative effects would appear in humans bodies. so, reducing noise pollution is an essential issue because it causes damage impacts on humans bodies. \r\n	As long as the indusrty of tools begun, researchers found new technology to reduce the noise in factories by wearing  special equipments such as head sets or redesigning the machines. Factories provide  headsets for the workers to prevent them from the dangerous effects of noise caused by machines( Fisher 27). Those devices are helful to reduce the number of deaf workers in the future bcause those equipments work effectively to protect the workers. In addtion, the desingers have made a new equipment to reduse the noise from its source, and that is the best way to eleminate the noise pollution( Fisher 27). Moreover, the future of producing machines without noise is becoming under people''s list of priority.\r\n	In conclusion, pollution noise is an important issue and it should be reduced because it has neagative effects in people health in  the two aspects phsyically and mentally. In addtion, lacking in hearing is one of the most common phsyical problems caused by noise pollution. Moreover, the diclination in sleep and being stressed are considered mental negative effects of noise polluiton. governments corporating with factories are trying to help solve this issue by doing much effort in designing new tools to reduce the noise pollution, and as they say "protection is btter than cure."

But as technology is pushing society development, the negative effects also are coming. Various kinds of pollution like environmental pollution, light pollution, noise pollution, have happened in people'' daily life. One of them, noise pollution problems have been raisen to a high level. According to David Fisher, the author of the artice "Noise Pollution", the effects of noise pollution includes the hearing demage, mental disturbances, productivity reducing, worsely death. He analyses these defferent influences by discribing how defferent kinds of noise impact people''s life. It is an clear answer that people should eliminatenoise pollution especially around their communities because it causes hearing demage, hurts people mentally, and "changes integral body functions" (David 27-28).\r\n	It is common sense that loud noise can hurt hearing. Eccessive noise, for example, the noise form trains, loud rock music, if people are exposed in those kind loud noise even though just a few minutes, their hearing will get varying levels of damage. What''s worse, peope even can lose theri hearing because of the extremely loud noise. When people heard a loud sound, they will feel pain in theri ears and may lose hearing in a short time. Extremely loud sond can shake the air and also people''s organs such as ears, which is the reason why people can get demage phydsically. Not only are noise harmful to people''s hearing, but also to mental state. \r\n	In additon, everyone knows noise can hurt sleep but just a few people realize that noise can cause psychological disturbances. David points out that noise interrupts sleep and makes people to be axious, especially the they consider the noise is avoidable(Divid 27-28). For example, in James Berlins'' article " Mont County Vows To Crack Down On Noise Pollution At Ride On Depot", He reports that the resudents near the bus depot, they can hear the bus idling every night and every early morning, which is a kind of torture to them. People will make more mistakes when they are in a noisy area than a quiet place. Also, the effects on people'' body  are serious enough to be considered. \r\n	Last but not least, noise can cause some changes of people''s integral body functions such as the brain working, heart beating, breathing and muslce mobility(David 27-78). Experts had some experiments on animals and tested the defferent reaction of body, which may be similar to people''s reaction. The mains reason of these changes result from noise. That is the reason why people may be mad in a noisy situation. But we also need to consider the solution of reducing noise\r\n	How to solve the noise problems should be taken into consideration. Nowadays, there are some samples of solution, for exmaple, governments build the barrier on the sides on train rouds in the cities. Also, they set up some laws that people can not make loud noise to bother neighbors or others especially for parties. What''s more, government also build some trees, which can reduce and block the spreading of noise between manufactring companies and communities. For bus depot, Jamse gives people an example, the drivers should obey the policy that bus ilding should be limited within three minute(James B8). \r\n	In conclusion, people should eliminate the noise pollution in their communities because noise can demage hearing, hurt people mentally, and change body function. Even though some people enjoy loud rock music, but it may bother the other people. And people should do something to reduce noise like listening lond rock music by wearing headset. Governments also play an important role in reducing noise. People are willing to have a peaceful community rather than a noisy one.

However, people should sacrfices many thing in oreder to live in a modren place in a city such as a quiet life. Once you are in a modren city with all kind of development, you should know that there will be no quiet life any more. Many people, who live in modren cities, complain about the noises that they have. Noise pollution is a new problem that was born by the development in human being life. Yet, many people may lessen the souriness of this problem, because they do not suffre from it. However, studies should that noise pollution could harm the human being in many ways. There are three main things for why the noise pollution should be taken seriouse such as it could harm the human being phsically, mentally, and it even could causes the deth of a human being. \r\n	To start with, noise pollution can harm a human body phiscally. Many people, who works in an enviroment that have a great deal of noises such as people who work in repairing the streets, complain about hearing issues that they suffer from. Moreover, people, who work at the airport have the same issue too. Studies showed that those people are more vernuble to have hearing issues on the baises of their job. As a result, they suffer from many phsical problems, which were caused by the noise pollution. Studise showed that working in a noisy enviroment can change the body function of a human being.(Fisher, David) It effects the electrical activity of the brain, which may effects the ability of thinking and proccssing the information.(Fisher, David) Further, noise pollution can also effects the heart rates, which going to effect the breathing effects as a result. One of the changes that result from the changing in body function is the breathing rates. Breathing rates can also be effected by the noise pollution, which may cause the tirdeness of the person since there is no enough O2 in his muscles. As a result, it reduces the productivity of the person, which leads to another phsical problem which is econmeic losses. To sum up, noise pollution have many effects that can harm the human body and the development that we are all foucing our power to. \r\n	Secondly, noise pollution have many mental effects on a human being. Noise pollution dose not effects people who worke in a noisy evviroments; it goes beyond that to the people around that noisy enviroment. For instance, many people are complaing from the noise thta is causing by the Ride On bus depot in Silver Spring. (Berlin, James) Those people complaining because they could not sleep at night. Not that only, they also complaining because of the all time noise that these buses cause, which prevent them fro having few houres of slitneness. (Berlin, James) Not sleeping enough causes many issues in the mental health of a human being. It leads to be worry and nervous all the time. It also prevent the person from doing his duties completely. Moreover, it lessen the person cearitvaity. Noise pollution cause many other mental problems can effects negativally in one''s life. \r\n	Finally, noise pollution can even causes the death of a person. A human being can only stands about 120 dB at maxiumem. Normally a person should listen to only 50dB for his saftey. But what those noisy work enviroment is making hte worker varulble to hear up to 150 dB, which may cause the death of a person or at least it could damage the person''s ear for a life time. \r\n	All in all, noise pollution should be taken seriously becuase of its harmfull damages on a human being body. It can harm a person phsically in may ways such as changing the person''s heart beats rates, which leads to change the person''s breathing rates, which finally leads to lessing the muscles mobility. Also, noise pollution can damage the person''s mental health by preventing him from sleep or having enough sleep, which eventually effetcs his ability in doing his duties and prevent his brain from doing his normall funcation. Moreover, it could cause the death of a person or lossing his ability of hearing for a life time. To avoid all these effects peole should work in eliminating the noise pollution in their communities. Foe instance, the government should put a fee for noise pollution in order to rduce it. Also, they should put the noisy enviroments or work places such as airports far a way from residential areas. Fruther, to prevent workers from having hearing injurey they provide them with headohones that reduce the noise pollution around them. (Fisher, David) To sum up, noise pollution is a serious problem that we should get rid of to prevent the negative effects and to have a beautiful eviroment to live in.

Many people, on the one hand, enjoy listening to music appropiately without turning it so up or loud. On the other hand, other people only like to listening to loud music, but do complain when it comes to industrial noise, buses noise, etc. because they think it is harmful. Therefore, sound has both positive and negative effects or purposes. For example, music is appreciated by people because it can make them relaxed - a positive effect. However, it can also cause damages to human well being. People, especially governments, should work hard in order to eliminate noise pollution in their communities because it does bother neighborhood and causes damages to human hearing, in particular those ones who are frequently exposure to loud sounds such as constructor workers.\r\n	The first reason that leads people to think government should work hard to exterminate noise pollution is "annoyance to neighbors," says David Fisher. People should live in harmony and peace, they have the right to feel comfortable when they are at home, in streets, wherever they are. Therefore, an excellent community should be able to provide the qualities mentioned above to all members who live in the community. According to David, noise pollution causes psychological problems to people living in a certain community. David''s point is that noise pollution bothers people when they are sleeping, and by doing so, negative effects rise such as irritability. Furthermore, James Berlin illustrates that residents were complaining on Ride On Bus depot in Silver Spring. That was a noise poluution result that led people to complain because the residents of that area were feeling incomfortable, irritable, and tense. Further, a resident said that they could hear the noise at night and morning (Berlin). These facts only show that noise pollution should be avoided because it irritates people.\r\n	The final reason that makes people think that noise pollution should be avoided by government, or people, is the damages which noise pollution can cause to human well being. The main human organ that noise pollution likely prejudices is ear because it is the organ that receives sounds. David states that hearing sounds loudly is harmful because it can cause hearing loss and other negative outcomes such as "integral body functions" and "muscle mobility". Here David explains that experiencing some of the noise pollution can also lead to heart, brain, and breathing problems. Besides causing problems to human well being, noise pollution also can cause problems to animals such as fatigue, lack of appetite, anxiety, blood pressure changes, etc., and some of these effects likely happen on humans even though it has insufficiently been approved (David). For these reasons, people should eliminate noise pollution in their communities taking some actions that can reduce noise pollution. In order to stop eliminate noise pollution, lawmakers have already modified and adjusted some old laws (David). The main objective of these laws is to protect workers working in overexposure to noise pollution. In addiction, these laws consist in a set of "limits," or "parameters," which requires all companies to apply, such as levels and power of noise in decibel, and treatments for employees (David).\r\n	To conclude, people really should work hard in order to eliminate noise pollution in their communities. Noise pollution causes annoyance to people either during the night or day, and causes serious damages to human well being such as hearing loss, psychological illness, etc. It also causes damages to animals. Therefore, people have to efficiently work to exterminate noise pollution in order to prevent disorders, or illness. Government should also work to eliminate noise pollution, especially in companies where workers are constantly exposure to loud noise. Communities should be pleasant.

They like to hear the sound clearly so they raise the sound to the maximum level to be enjoyable and danceable. When people raise the sound, they will enjoy the music and the beats of music. Despite enjoying the sound of the music, in recent days, the number of industrial companies are increasing dramatically and the noise which is produced there may have many negative imapcts in human''s body. It also annoying people who are living near by these industrials companies. This noise made a big concern workers and the residents, which called noise pollution, because the high level of noise can cause many harmful diseases and disturbe people to live their life peacefully. People should work to eliminate the noise pollution by being away from high level noise and by providing ears care for the labors and residents and supervisors to control the noise.\r\n	People can avoid the high level of noise by staying away a distance from the source of high level sound. Noise pollution harms human''s body by causing many diseases to the ear and it also have many physical and mental effects on the body. According to David Fisher, exposing to noise can harm the ears. It may reduce the efficiency of hearing in long term depending to the time and the sound level which the ear have exposed. Human''s ear have the ability to hear up to 90 dB without having medical issues, but if it exceeded over 90 dB for the noise in one-third of the day for five days a week. Furthermore, people should not be exposed to 120 dB without wearing ears protection, so exposing to over 120 dB of noise without protection may make the ear vulnerable to ear damges (27-28). Hearing lessens and losses are not the only damage that the noise cause. Noise pollution has another bad impact on the internal body working such as brain electrical activity for giving orders, breathing rates, and blood pressure. As widely known, Being in high noise prevent the person from sleeping beacause many people sleep in quite place and being in away from high level sounds. if the person exposed to exssesive level of sound volume, they might be tired and anxious because of lack of sleeping or pressure. In addtion, the production of the worker will reduce because they cannot concentrate on the work or because of lack of sleeping due to noise. "Noise can therefore be the cause of hear loss, mental illness, reduced productivity, or evn loss of life," (Fisher). People can avoid this problems by making the companies offer hearing devices for employees that decreases the exessive amout of noise and make them hear clear sound. There are many gizmos that reduces the noise such as ear plugs, which is made from cotton, and headsets. The best solution is by being away from constuction, industries, and railroads. For example, many students in South Carolina are annoyed from train''s sound which prevent them from sleeping. As a result they are trying to find an apartment away from railroads. Overall, to prevent noise pollution diseases, the best way is by being away from noise.\r\n	Industrials companies that have a lot of workers who work in high level of noise should provide health care for them. Not only the workers have the right to get medical care, also residents who live nearby noise and big cities that prevent them to live their lives peacefully should have medical care. These people are exposed to high level of noise which affects thier health. These ear devices can be found in any pharmacy so it is easy to get it. Moreover, the goverment should provide a supervisor to be surrvielance on people who make noise. According to James Berlin, in Mont County, there is a bus stop that have many complains from residents because of the noise the they make. Each bus have a three minutes limit to stop, but many drivers are going on the opposite side. A video showed that they stop for 30 minutes. As a result, Mont County made an oversight to prevent drivers from stopping by making laws for whom are not following the laws. Although this problem is hard to solve because it needs a long time to convience people to reduce the sounds and some of these sounds come normally with the work like constructions. Workers can reduce the sounds by working in a time that people do not get rest and using meterials that do not cause loud sounds. Many people say, "Prevention is better than cure." Buying or providing ear devices are the best solution for people who suffer from noise pollution.\r\n	In conclusion,  in recent days, many people trend to turn the sound to the maximum level. Also, many industrial companies are producing annoying sound for the residents and even workers cannot handle this sounds. Noise pollution cause many diseases such as hearing loss and mental ilness. People should work to eliminate noise pollution by staying away from noise sources and providing a supervisors and medical care for people who workers and people who are suffering from noise pollutuion, The government should have many solution to prevent these industrials companies from producing noisy sounds and even people who make this noise without thinking about other people.', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '11.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '15.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.50', '2.75', '2.75', '2.50', '2.50', '13.00', '2.5', '2.8', '2.8', '2.5', '2.5', '13.1', 0, ''),

Nature, the serounding envirnment, was compitable with that procedure of simple life. that dream of buteaful life was ended when manufacturing revolution has been started. A new technologies was used to create new facilities and tools that aim to make people life easier. In fact, manufacturing revolution is the best thing that goals to help people but with a the right restrictions and proper legelizations it could be considered as a wepon that would affect people and earth future as well. eventually, manufacturing harts people life as well as natural life be causing noise polution.  In realiaty, some people do not know how noise polution will affect their life because they think that this kind of loudy voices that they could sustain with it. In fact, that is totally wrong and people should eliminate noise pollution in their communities since these kinds of noise hurt people health, change  animal life hapit and affect people and earth futre.\r\n	First, noise pollution can drive to many types of diseases. Normally, people get used to take rest after they finish their works. In that situation, human body is totally exhusted and need some sleep to refresh its activities and be ready for the next day. When loudy voices pollute the serenety of people while they are taking their rest. That would lead to nagative consequences. Davi Fisher, in his article, "Noise Pollution", describes that noise polution lead to many types of dengrous disease sush as hearing loss, changing in integral body fuctions like brain electrical performance, heart beat rate , breathing rate and muscle movment (Fisher).  For instance,he mentioned that there are specific ranges of sound volum that people allow to exposure to. Fisher describes that exposure to more that 90 db noise for more than 8 hours five days per week could drive to permentent hearing damage. Moreover, there are another kind of disease as fisher has mentioned whish is psychological disease such as becoming tense, irritable especially when the noise cannot be avoided. Fisher says that noise pollution is an epidamic diseases. As a result, people should eliminate noise pollution to healthier life.\r\n	Second, noise pollution has a big effects on animals hapits. animals accoustomed to live in calm environment. Birds, for example, get used to sleep at thier home on the trees in a calm coditiones unless natural coditions such as lighting and thundering but peopele invade their invironment by perfoming alof of irresponsible activities such singing or performing sport activities. Indeed, after manufacturing processes have been expanded to involve animal environment such as build alot of homes and manufactures near to wild area.  Animals future would affect by these kinds of noises and may that lead to but some of animals in dengerous. Actually, these irresponcible activities belong to the lack of legelization of  robust rules that eforce people to avoide making noise near to animal environments. Absent of strong monitoring push some workers to make noices during night hours. This concept reported by James Berlin, inhis writting, "ont ounty  ows To Crack Down on Noise Pollution at Ride on Depot". He reports that some buses drivers make noises during night hours when there is a leack of supervisor to monitor them (Berlin). Indeed, it is clear that such kind of activities no matter whowever was the responsible, they lead to affect people as well as animalls.\r\n	lastly, noise pollution drive to change life on earth. Of forgoing, noise pollution affects people health in general. Imaging people with different types of  medical disease as well as psychologicak diseases give a terrible picture of the future life of earth. All relationships between people , in socielt, would filled with alot of angur and hate because of prevailing psychological and medical diseases. Further more, people original home the earth would be one of victims of the noise pollution since this kind of pollution push to chane the animal distribution map on the earch. onsequencelly, earth future would face some areas that do not contain many types of animals. Therefore, people should eliminate noise pollution to save their futur.\r\n	In conclussion,  noise pollution is a kind of epidemic diseses. In fact, these noises drive to prevailing different types of medical problems as well as psychological problems. Also, pollution noices push to make some types of wild animals because they affect their living environment. To save and improve people lives as well as animals governmental agences should put profesional supervisor to monitor people behaivior and prevent them from hurtting life on the earth.', '00:00:00', '2.5', '0.5', '1.0', '3.0', '2.0', '9.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.5', '2.5', '13.5', '1.5', '2.0', '1.0', '2.5', '2.0', '9.0', '2.00', '1.25', '1.00', '2.75', '2.00', '9.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

One of the most important effects is the Pollution, which causes our planet sufer from many problems related to use fuels and other harm materials in many diffrent industrial activeties. Pollution containes many types and one of them is the Noise Pollution which has more serious effects on human like other types of Pollution. Many research were done to find that effects and many efforts have been done to reduce these effects. In my opinion the effects of Nosie pollution could be categorised as the effects on hearing, the increase of some deseases, and the sychological effects on human.\r\n	the Noise effects our ears which have a limits of hearing sounds, and all the sounds which we hear should not excced that limits. Fisher shows that the safe Noise level should not axcced 90 dB, and hearing a Noise level more than 150 dB could cause a harm to our ears that could not be fixed (Fisher,27-28). however, many protections should be done to prevent and control the bad effects of the Noise especially for the workers in high level Noise industries. Fisher also gives an example of using foam earplugs and especial type of headsets to reduce the effects of working machines in that types of factories (Fisher,27-28). \r\n	the second bad effects of Noise Pollution is the increasing of many deseases in human which have been found that related to expose to many types of Noise. Many of these deseases are very hard to treat and coast the pitent and the community. Fisher lists theme by saying that "Other effects include changes in integral body functions, such as the electrical activity of the brain, heart and breathing rates, and muscle mobility" (Fisher,27-28). Moreover, he gives some evedance about other effects on animals which many resaechers think that they have the same effects on human (Fisher,27-28). So, this evedance make many communites work to prevent the effects of the Noise Pollution by many types. One of thse types is by making a claim in the court against the industrial activity which cause that Noise polution, for example, Berlin shows the claim which has been done by the communty in Silver spring against the bus company, because their buses are making Noise in around the day and how they won this cliam (Berlin, B8). therefore, all the communities or the individuals should make all the eeforts to reduce this kind of Pollution in order to reduce it is bad effects.\r\n	finaly, the Noise Pollution also has some sychological effects on human and may cause dengerous problems. Fisher lists these sychological effects by the sleep and speech problems, also the feeling of lonliness and many mental illness (Fisher, 27-28). These types of effects may led to life loss and cause many problems in any human who expouse to these Noise for a long time. Therfore, any project when has been designed should take the Noise effects in conceder, especially for the workers inside that kind of activity, because they are the closest people to the source of Noise and have the loing contact with it. Some efforts to reduce Noise damage could be done by sound engineers who have the knoledge to reduce the Noise in any industry site (Fisher, 27-28).\r\n	Some readers may argue aganist my view by saying that Noise is something related to our life, and there are many natural Noise like the sound of thunder or the sound of the birds or other natural sounds. On the one hand I agree with this claim because we hear these sounds and we enjoy it and it has no bad effects on our health, but these type of natural sounds are not contineous in our life, also these sounds have been created within our hearing level and never axcced the limits. Also, in our nature we like to live in quite environment, and in many case the nature sounds make us more comfort and relax.\r\n	In short, Noise Pollution is very harmful and affects our life by crating many illness problems related to our physical activeties or our mental activities. So, all of us, individuals and commuities, should do our best to reduce that type of Pollution especally after many research showed the evidence of it is bad effects. In addition to that, we should solve this problem from the begining, I mean that any project and before being applied in reality has many studies about it efficiency, like economic study and the sutable structural design, I think any project should have a study about the Noise pollution which will cause it to the workers and to the naghbour coumuinty.', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.5', '2.5', '2.5', '3.0', '2.0', '11.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.25', '2.75', '2.50', '2.50', '2.25', '12.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, '');

Whem people are together in places (cities, factures , audiences, etc.) the noise pollution becames a inevitable issue once everyone might speak and work near by each other. Such problem is not new, it is also related in old poems and stories from the middle ages on the medieval Europe. Reading a quote where says that "The horses'' noise, caused by the hit of their horseshoe, on a brick street in Paris at a early morning [...]" . In fact, today as an industrialized society where almost everything is made in factures with large machines or even a mineral exploration in some subterrain mine, noise pollution effects people more and more. The noise pollution has many effects on people''s lives, as said by Fisher "High levels of noise are harmful to human well being, and noise pollution needs to be controlled". It can cause ear damage and distub the peace and order. Perhaps the mass that suffers more with those issues are the works; working in a facture handle with heavy and anoing machines. Therefore, people and business owners should work to eliminate noise pollution on their communities viewing a better life for everybody and thus preventing people to suffer ear damage and keep the peace and order on the city and neighborhood. \r\n	In the world where the societies are placed today avoing noises are a hard job to do and suffer with ear damage seems be almost impossible wheter people live in large cities or work in large industries. Open areas are hard to control the noise pollution as whole. For example, how could engeenerings solve the problem with noise in airports where planes are loading and reloading all time at day? How could they handle with the noise made but large factures statements in industrial areas? Some of issues are hard to deal with wheter the noise effects an area but others simples ways might solve individual problems as in work places. Perhaps, the factures laborers are the mass which suffers more damage despite of the overexposure in their work day. Some effects which a worker might suffer after a work day is hear ringing or buzzing in their ears (Fisher). Problem with laborers in mining and industies could be solve by simple equipments, the laborers should be require to wear equipments that reduce the noise level, as earplugs and passive headsets (Fisher). Being exposed to a long period of time in excess of 90 dB for hours a week can lead a permanent ear problem to a person wheter the person stay expossed on those noise during thirty to forty years, and also being expossed to noise of 150 dB or above can damage the ear beyong repair (Fisher). Seening those problems over the mass of works in the industry sector, lawers changed and created  laws to help the laborers. Fisher says that "Fortunately, many victims of noise pollution have filed complaints in court". \r\n	Although the noise pollution issue  may effects more laborers than other people jobs, everyone is effected by it and so effecting also the peace and order of a neighborhood. The common society today have some law such as turn down the loud music around 10:00 p.m. and it is very important for a good convivence among neighborhoods. Countries have created agencies to help prevent and create limits to noise production on cities and industrial areas. However, people still saying that they are hearing for year and years the loud noise around their neighborhood and those agencies did nothing. Berlin reports in his article a speech made by a citizen, Peek, who live in a area where buses are doing many noises where he said "The noise is three times the Enviromental Protection Agency''s limit". In addiction, Berlin also reports that "Some residents say for two decades they have compleined about round-the-clock noise from the buses."  Suche problem should be deal by the local government to prevent the noise pollution and thus make the people''s lives better. Even though people do not work in places where loud noise are create, some people might live near places where loud noises are create and making people irritated, tense and having some psychological disturbances if they had a interruption of sleep.\r\n	In conclusion, living in a large city or working in a loud facture should be not painfull, the noise pollution should be prevent by the population and the business owners because it effects not just the ear system or the peace but it can cause hearing loss, mental illness, reduced productivity, blood pressure changes, narrowing of the blood vessels, muscle mobility and body functions such as the electrical activity of the brain (Fisher). Wheter people chose live in cities they should respect each other and so they could live in a better life.  Preventing noise pollution should be a issue where everyone should help. Governments should care about these issue once it is a subject where everyone is include.

(321, '2014-07-21', 600015369, 2014, 3, 'a', '    Have you ever faced a situation where your neighbour made a noise complaint agenst you? Well, nowadays people consider noise as type of pollution and they call it noise pollution. Noise pollution is the loud sounds that may annoy people around it for instence, in neighbourhood, building construction or  even some loud construction such as, airports. And also noise pollution can effect people in many different ways, in the article Noise Pollution estemate that, " Industrial noise pollution effects people in various ways. It causes annoyance to neighbors, particularly in residential areas where industrial plants have been built nearby."(p1). People should be aware that noise can impact on people their life and ruin it, and also thet should elimenate noise pollution, because it is one of the main reasons that cause health problems such as, mental health and physical health. \r\n     First of all, mental health is important because with a good mental health people can work better, pruduce better and have a good life, mental health is connected to people success, but the question is how people can maintain their mental health in a good condition? Well, the healthy body needs a healthy mind and there is many things can can lead to mental and physical illness and one of them is noise pollution. Noise pollution have a huge influence on mental health because it reduce their ability to focus, if people cannot cant focus they wont be able to study, create and work hard and with those three materials people can help the world to develop, but noise pollution can put a weight of pressure in someones shoulder and it is more annoying when the person know that the noise can be reduced or prvented, and also if the noise can interfere with sleeping time which is the rest time, and it can cause many mental problems such as, depression and brain damage, in the article Noise pollution established that ," Apart from these physical changes, noise can cuase psycological disturbance. Interruption of sleep by noise can cause people to become tense, irritable, and resentful about the cause of noise, especially if they are convinced that the noise is avoidable."(p1). Some people think that noise pollution it cannot be harmful or damage the mental health but unfortunatly it does. \r\n    Second, the physical health it is the peson body condition it can be healthy or not, but if the person lost one of his senses it will be difficult to compare himself with another successful person, and there is a connectoin between the physical health and the mental health, some physical issues can lead to mental health because the person doesnt have the ability to do a certain thing anymore which can make him dispreate. Noise pollution can corrupt one of the senses which is the sense of hearing by reaching the high level of sound noise that human ears cannot handle, in the article Noise Pollution included that, " So luod noise is dangeruos and a health hazard, but what exactly are the acceptable parameters, or limits, for exposure to excessive noise? Exposure to noise in excess of 90 dB (decible, which is an index, or standerd measure, of the power of sound) for eight hours in any twenty-four hours for five days a week can lead to permanent hearing damage exposure continues over period of thirty to forty years." (p1). And also there is many othe diseases may caused by hearing luod noise. For example, electrical signals that comes from the brain to control the body, heart beats and braething as well. Noise pollution can raise the blood presure which it can cause other diseases. \r\n    In conclusion, basically noise pollution is prevented everywhere by the law, because it has more disadvantages than the advantages. Moreover, people believe that noise pollution only prevented in neighborhoods because it is a living area, but is not true noise pollution has been prevented everywhere, and many people will not allowed to disturb their areas by making certain action to prevent this noise pollution which can make it difficult to other institutoin to work like, For example, in the article Mont County Vows To Crack Down On Noise Pollution At Ride On Depot conclued that, " Everyone working at the depot has not been following established operating standards..... We have taken a number of steps to prevent this problem from recurring." (p1). Those peole used their authority to prevent the noise pollution from developing.

Pollution, a problem that affects many important areas, like air, water, and even human hearing, is gradually groing to exacerabate because of the continuous development of this new age of the world. Centuries ago, a horse was necessary to move people from one place to another, now  modern society has what they call "car", an important tool for human daily life, but it is causing what many people may say noise, and technically noise pollution. In fact, despite of the negative impacts of technology on the society, it is important to juxtapose the effects of this pollution and the agents that can help . Noise polluiton instigaste mental and physical illness; and two important agent might help to reduce the effects of it, companies and population. \r\n\r\n	As known , even things inheretely good can have reversible or irreversible impact on humans lives. According to David Fisher on his article entitle "Noise Pollution," he states that noise is causing a lot of problem to human health. Fisher also describe two factors that contribute to human illness that is the time of exposure to noise. If a person is exposed to noise for a short period of time, the health conditon of this patient might be handled by having treatment; however, when he/she is exposed for a long period of time, the noise can deeply damage the person''s hearing, which most of the time is irreversible, because of a continuous exposure to noise.\r\nmoreover, this type of pollution cause mental diseases. People can loose thir hearing which is a liability to their life, they can also face "psycological disturbance," anxiety and so on. For example, due to the long or even short time exposure to loud sounds, when people are apart from that environment, they still hear the sound echoing in their mind, and it is unpleasent especially if the person want to sleep.\r\n\r\n	Human body reacts toward everything that is abnormal. Besides affecting human mind, noise pollution also has physical impact on human body, states Fisher. It can cause tiredness, insufficiency of appetite, and even paucity of sleep. As an illustration, Fisher reports a man who was impeded from sleeping by a truck  that was drove over near to his house, the man actually might have break the decorum, and was jailed. In fact, the noise was emanating from outside  and affecting his sleeping process, and it could affect inderectly his productivity at work. The exposure to loud sounds do not  cause only those physical and mental illness cited above, it can also take human lives, so it is important to be aware.\r\n\r\n	However since the world became industrialized, companies have been creating mechanism that facilitate their workers lifestyle, so that productivity grow and workers'' satisfation either. Companies today are facing a big challenge, most of the equipments that they use, is creating a lot of problems to their workers, and in this case, hearing problem. It is important for companies to provide equipment, like earplugs and passive haedest, which are tools that reduce the level of the sound, that will protect their workers; companies can also provide annual medical assistance for the workers. Taking this point in mind, the health of its workers will be controlled and easily any detriment would be avoided (Fisher27-28). \r\n\r\n	Another agent that can give its contribution to mitigate this problem are communities. Many people live near to roads, and others near to bus stations, and the noise comming from the automobiles might be unpleasent. Fisher reports that a automobile produces 90dB ( decibel, an index of to measure the power of the sound) and if a person is exposed to that noise for a complete day it can lead to irreversible damage on their hearing, now it is important to notice that a lot of noise is produced for 150 buses and other more automobile that near to residents (James Berlin); in fact, it is too much, so in order to change th current situation communities should gather together and prostest against it, but with a convincent argument, or suggeting those companies to create station a little far from houses, or suggest short time of bus standing near to houses. For example, Berlim reports that due to the continuos complain comming from residents, buses are required to stay near by for only three minut and oncew the time is gone, the car should be turned off, so attitudes like this will really help in noise reduction.\r\n\r\n	In conclusion, as a consequence of human intelligence, we are also suffering, but human can also create new meachnism that mitigate the current sitution. The exaggerated amountof noise is causing problems in human health, menatlly and physically, but there are two groups that can help. companies, providing equipment for their workers, and population creating assembly and show that the problem is affecting them and show better suggestion that can not only help communities, but also benefit companies. \r\n\r\n', '00:00:00', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '3.0', '12.5', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '14.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.50', '2.75', '2.25', '3.00', '13.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),
(316, '2014-07-21', 600015403, 2014, 3, 'a', '	In recent decades, many public problems have been known. One of them is noise pollution. Noise pollution is considered one of the importnat problem that is known in owr community. Rgardless the other problem, peopel have a bad attitude toward noise pollution. They have suffered from this problem for many years. Althought, the advenced techonolgy that humens have invnted , this problem affects human being directly and many effects could lead to unpleasnat end.Many studies say that  this problem should be or needs to control. Consequently, there are many effects of noise pollution that should be solved, however the main effects are centered in tow main effects, which are human''s effects and communities effects.\r\n\r\n   	First, nosie pollution is considered one of the harmful effects for human''s health. The high levels of noise are harmful and affect in human direclty, espicially in residental areas, even though that there are many cpmplaints have been filed in courts. Ear damage also could make the person lose his ability to hear, in this case, the sound is probabely become distort with the person. Some of the victimes who are sufferd from the exposure that happened to them got a permenant damage in their ear. This case happens when the person face a high levels of noise for a long time, and even if the person could be recovered from that damage, it will take a long duration. The other dangerous of loud noise is that the person could have a problem in in some functional processes in their body. According to David Fisher, the person could have problem that are cauesd by loud nise, such as health problem in some activities in the brain, heart and breathing rates and others. He also says thet there are many studies that have been made for some animlas, and during the test, they noticed the direct effects, such as " The size of glands, blood pressure changes, and narrowing of the blood vessels." That results are the some effctes that could happen for human beings. In addetion, hearing a loud noise for a long time could make the person to have kind of anxice,tense and concern, which leads to have some interruptions in person''s sleep. Mnay people who are living near or next to the road suffer from the problem directly. Furthermore, many employees have the same propblem when they got niose pollution. Consequently, many companies are required them to wear devices that could protect them from the nosie, such as foam and headests ( Fisher 27-28). What is important, ther are many problem that could occur and affect the human body.\r\n	second, many people and communities are suffering from nosie pollution. The problem could be increased with those commuinties that have a huge number of pobulation. The cars, busses and other kind of vheicle are going back and forth everyday. The problem could increase with those who are resident or live next to the street. The perosn, some time, could go back from his job to time for realx and spend some time with his family, but because of the niose that is coming from the street, he or she will stay at their home looking at the street and feeling anger toward the noise. Many residents have complainted and atteneded the court because of this situation. James Berlin says that they have made many investigation and got many complaints from some residents to understand what are some causes for nosie pollutioin that occur next tho them. One of the causes is the ideling ride on buses tape.They noticed that these buses stay idling for a long time, or more than three minutes. The probelm here is that the idling is going for a long distance and harm many resoidents that are near the bus station. As a result of that, thay have taken many steps to prevent this problem from occuring or to eliminate it. He say that thay also have followed kind of observation or supervision steps, such as putting supervisors in place where the buses are stoppedd to make suer that drivers turn their buses off before they cross the  three mintues limit that has been specified. In addetion, and noticeably, there are alot of residents who were live near the street, they moved far away from the nosie that occurs in the steert. They have complants for many yaers, but becuase of some steert are irreplaceable, they did not got what they want. Moreover, there are other sources for making noise among the communities, shuc as digging up in the street or even on one''s house. David say that one person in britain was jailed for his digging up in his house, which prenet other from sleeping. However, some studies show that the noise that is coming from the steert or other source remain indispinsaple. \r\n	In conclusion, noise pollutoin should be controlled, because, generally, it affects human''s health and could lead to some problems in the community. There are many new technology have been discovered to solve or eleminate the problem. Some companies are following some critical steps to reduce the problem and to protect their employees. To be in the safe side, the person should protect himself and solve the problem by himself, whether living far a way from the noise of the street or the work of some companies. It is better to stay away from the problem instead of ingaging in it an then get some undesirable consequences.

On one side, we can find who thinks high level of noise is more pleasurable, on the other side we can find who consider it is harmful. Noise pollution is the excess of noise that can be harmful to people. According to the definiton, we can assume that exists different kinds of noise pollution. The noise is considered a way of pollution when is is higher than 90dB. Thus, listening to loud music or a television program can be considered noise pollution. The noise produced by industrial companies and cars on the street can be considered as example of noise pollution. Considering that high levels of noise are dangerous for human well being, people should consider its effects and works in order to reduce or eliminate noise pollution in their communities.\r\n	Primarly, people should consider that everything present both sides good and bad. People who consider listining to loud music a pleasurable activity, they should consider that this activity can has important effects for their health, such as ear damage. Ear damage is the most commun and frequent problem related to noise pollution, which can be reversible according to the time of exposure to excessive noise levels but, permanent damage may occur when someone is exposured to higher than 90dB without proper hearing protection. The most knowledge effect of noise pollution is permanent hearing damage. However,  we can see more effects of it such as some changes in the human body. According to the article "Noise pollution", David Fisher says "other effects include changes in integral body functions, such as the electrical activity of the brain, heart and breathing rates, and muscle mobility." Although, noise pollution presents physical changes, it also brings psycological disturbances. Fisher says "Interruption of sleep by noise can cause people to become tense, irritable, and resentful about the cause of noise." For instance, a person who lives close to industrial area and is affected by noise pollution during the night, in the morning he can be tense because the time that he could not sleep well because of the noise produced by industries. At his job he can shows less produtivity and efficiency.\r\n	Secondly, people should work to eliminate noise pollution in their comunity. As showed, noise pollution can has physical and mental effects. As a result, people should try to avoid this kind of problems because it is harmful for themselves. According to the article "Mont County Vows To Crack Down On Noise Pollution At Ride On Depot" James Berlin says "The issue with residents is not only the presence of the depot, but some of the regulations for the buses, which includes leaving some of them running." Taking account the information from this article, it means the neighborhood had complained about the running of the buses during the night and early in the morning. In order to eliminate this problem from their community, people from this community made the neighbors commisioned to know about that, which realised a investigation. Peek says "The noise in three times the Environmental Protection Agency''s limit." The results of the investigation confirms that the community was right about the noise caused by buses, and the general policy of that community was working to prevent that problem. In general, there are some actions that people can take to reduce noise pollution such as, reduce the level of sound produced in their homes specially during the night, don''t scream in public locations, reduce the mobility of buses during the night, companies should not work at night and the establishement of several laws to penalise people and companies that not follow the rules.\r\n	In sum, noise pollution is a problem that has affeted the population. Showing both side of this issue, people should consider them each time they are talking about noise pollution. As a result, pleasurable activities may become harmful resulting in physical and mental effects, if some regulations are not followed by people. Even though, some effects caused by noise may take time to be showed, the best way to prevent them in order to it not be showed and damage the health, people should follow the rules and do their best.

Most people in the past did not find a suitable thing to sit on. They depended on the surrounding environments to find something suitable for thier bodies, because they have experienced that spending a long time standing could hurt them. So the science in this issue have been started for decades. This science involves the detabases among people of which is important of what is the way people sit or what is the thing that people sit on while working. Therefore, people should focus on the thing they sit on because it is more important. What people sit on while working is more imporatant because it is more comfortable and more healthier.\r\n	First and formost, What people sit on could be more comfotable. One of the subjects that people need to think about is what is the thing that they need to sit on while working. There are a lot of kinds of chairs that can be suitable for people while they are working in their jobs. Some of these chairs can be comfortable and some of them can be harmful. In an article "The Science of Sitting", the writer points out that the uncomfotable chairs can lead to some problems and pain in the body of the person who use the uncomfotable chairs like feeling tired (Fisher). These uncomfortable chairs will impact employees while they are working to be less productive and that will be a problem for the companies. As a result,  whatever tthe price is, people should buy a siutable and comfortable chair. In an articl "Sitting In", the author asserts that people should buy a siutable and comfotable chirs that they can buy (Berlin). So peopel should sit on a comfortable chairs.\r\n	 In addition, it is more important to sit on a chair that could help the body to be healthy. Most people are working for a long time and the result that they usually are suffering from pains in their bodies. For example, syudents usually are spending such a long time for a test which means that they are qualify to get aches in different areas in thir bodies like in their backs. There are study says that people who are being sit or stand for a long time could be killed by this situation ( Berlin). So the thing people are sitting on is important because it should be healthier.\r\n	In conclusion, What is sat on is more important because it is could be more helthier and comfortable.\r\n  \r\n	', '00:00:00', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '10.5', '2.5', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '14.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.50', '2.50', '2.25', '2.50', '2.50', '12.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

However, people who work inside or outside are same becuase every indevisual one can make his or her work comfortable or not. One of the biggest factors that make the work inside a buliding more comfortable is the sitting position. Sitting postion is very important for the workers because it can affect their health. Also, multiple positions is very important for the workers.\r\n	When people do somethings more than usual, they will affected with bad results. For example, when a person spend most of the time reading and readding, that will be agianst his health and will affcet his eyes and his back with some problems. Even though reading is a good thing to do, doing that more than usual will affect the person health badly. Also working is a good thing for the person because in the work enviormant, the worker should be work, move, doing something that need power or energy not like a person who sit in home watching movies and the Cokacola in the right hand and pop corn in the left hand. Thus, person in the work should not be like the person in the home, worker should move and work not just sit on the chair. According to James Berlin, in his article " Sitting In," says that a lot of studies shows that sitting all the time will affect the person''s health badly and some of these studies recommend people to spend more time moving and not sitiing all the time (Berlin). However, some works require that worker should be in the office work on the computer and sitting on the chair all the time. Therefore, these companies should afford healthy chairs for the employees which can adjusted by the person. \r\n	Healthy chairs whcih can adjusted by the worker is very importnat for the companies nad workers. The healthy chairs should be adjustable. According to Daived Fisher, in his article " The Science of Sitting" says that in the theoreis of the scientist Staffel about the healthy postions of sitting, " He recommended a stright posture of the tunk, neck, and head, similar to the desired back postture when standing erect." (Fisher). Therefore, the healthy position is the stright back while sitting on chairs according for this theory. However, Fisher don''t agree with this theory nad he agree with chairs that allow the workers to move and to move their body. Fisher says that " many postures may be comfotable (healthy, suitable, efficient, etc.) for short periods, depending on one''s body type, physical prefrences, and work activites," (Fisher). Thus, workers should feel free to move on their chairs and to adjust the comfortable position for them while sitting down and work.\r\n	In the concolusion, the workers should work in a healthy and comfortable enviromant and one of the main factor to feel comfortable while working is that sitting with proper posion because that will affect the health of the worker. Companies, who require sitting on chair and work and they don''t allow the workes to move in the working hours, should provide healthy chairs for their employees to work comfortable. The proper chair is the chair that allow the person to adjust the positions. \r\n	', '00:00:00', '3.0', '2.5', '2.0', '3.0', '2.5', '13.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '14.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.75', '2.50', '3.00', '2.50', '13.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

"with study after study caliming that sitting all day is killing you" says Berlin. While many doctors agree that sitting for a long time is harmful. In recent discussions of back pain problems a controversial has been whether we put more value on our sitting ways or on what we are sitting on.\r\n	On the one hand , some argue that the way we sit is more important.From their perspective, ther are many wrong sitting positions which might hurt the back on the long term. For example, although Fisher thinks that standing is healthier than sitting, he mentioned ,in his article"The scince of sitting", many theories about sitting health. One of them was for Staffel who recommended to sit on a striaght shape for the neck , head and trunk, in a way that is simmilar to the back position while standing. While other scientists say that for short periods many postures could be healthy and suiable yet that depends on the body type ,the activies and the physical preferences.(Fisher,2000)\r\n	On the other hand ,however, Others argue that the furniture on which we sit is more important. Because, From their views, "Furniture should allow for body movements and various postures"(Fisher,2000). They justify their opinions by saying that workers should be able to adjust their seats and chairs in height and angle and other key design feartures(Fisher,2000). What they meant to say is that when the seat is comfortable and flexable, it allows the user to sit in a healthy positions and postures. In the words of one of this view proponents Berlin says " A good chair is a sound investment". He adds in his article "Sitting In " that the flexibility in the chair provides an " Ideal position" which keeps your back muscles relaxed. In other words, people who are from this side believe that the furniture type is more important becasue if it is flexable and comfotable, it will provide a healthy postures.\r\n	My own view is that how we sit is more important . Although I concede that the seats flexibility and comfort may make them less harmful for the back, I still maintain that the way we sit is more affective. For instance, when we sit in a wrong way and leave our back unstraight and bended for a long time that would harm our backs whether we are using a very comfortable seat or a wooden chair. Even though some might argue that some chairs do not allow for healthy postures, I reply that it is impossible not to find at least three heathly postures for any chair whatever the chair is. Moreover I would add that there are plenty of healthy postures for sitting on the ground or on the rocks how when it comes to chairs.\r\n	In conclusion, we discussed people''s, who put more value on the sitting ways, opinions and how they justify that. We saw the opposite view which preferes the comfortable seats and how the proponents of this view see the issue from their angle.

Many people said that the way of sitting is more important because of their experiance. But in the other side the more people and researcher support that the thing what we sit on is more important. What we sit on while working is more important because sitting in comfortable chair is less tiring and more healthier.\r\n	First of all, comfortable chair is less tiring. It''s less tiring because sitting don''t make us spend a lot of power and it comfort our body. If your job is out of the company and make you work a lot in standing way, you have to take a break for rest your body. Every worker in that setuation prefer a comfortable place to sit on. Also, If your job is about working in the office with a computer, you have to have a comfortable chair to not getting tired from the sitting. Moreover if you have a shop or company and you have a customers visiting you, you have to offer a comfortable chairs for them to make them feel good about your dealing with them. When you want to buy a comfortable chair you care about the chair''s sizes, that is because a wrong size such as too high or too low (Helander and Zhang by Fisher). The modern offices furniture was desighned for sitting upright position because it''s the healthy sitting (Fisher)\r\n	In addition, comfortable chairs is more healthier. Everyone''s health is the most important thing in his\\her life. When you are taking about any kind of jobs you have, you have to offer a good place to the worker their. The most simple thing to offer in the good work place is comfortable chairs. That is bacause sitting or standing for a long time is uncomfortable and leads to many problems with worker like poor blood circulation and too much fluid build up in the lower legs (Fisher). And comfortable one doesn''t bring that. Also, sitting for a long time all the day is going to kill that body (Berlin). Moreover, doctors recommend a straight posture of the trunk, neck, and head (Fisher). However, sitting for a long time is not healthy. You have to change your sitting way and to stand to make some exersices like woking and moving arms to make your body and brine more active for time to time. \r\n	In sum, both the way of sitting and what we sit on while working is important. But still what we sit on as a comfortable chair is more important. That''s because it''s less tiring and more healthier.

What i mean here is, chairs that are afford in offices should help body movements and various postures (Dvid) also this can lead the chair''s user to healthier seat and  also can impact the function of the workers.\r\n\r\n	Second, Most of people care about coast of living and recently chairs have become an issental part of coast living, so prices are consedered as main foctor for some people, because some peopl will love to have a great chairs but the price prevents people to have them. For example ReGeneration chairs start at 676 dollars if thay have arms but if they do not, the price will be 540 dollars(James) in addtion to that chairs are devise for helping people to do their on intersts such as eating, having rest  and most of time doing work.\r\n Finally, chair should have different shapes and forms to attract users who are welling to spend long period of time on it, extra to  that, the shape of  chairs should be designed based on  flexibility in order to give the whole comfortness to the users. Some chairs were formed as hard as stone, which invests tha chair''s users to sit in difficult shape and this what could lead the user to have poor blood circulationb and fulid build-up for the user if the chair with lower legs(Daivd).Also people should know that heakthy sitting is sitting upright but also there are some factors which can lead to different sittings\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, shaping cahirs is one of the  most important factors that prevents unhealthy sitting, Also coasting can invest people to ignore the best shape or the best chair for them and offoring the best shape , it''s the function of the chairs during the working time, studying time and also being ready for unaccepted moving.\r\n\r\nBerlin,James."Sitting In."

Imagine that you work for long time and sitting on luxury chair with wrong position of sitting; You will get hurt in your body because of the unsuitable sitting. So if you do not know how to sit, You will not work well. While we work either sit down or stand up to do different activities. Some people think that to sit appropriately is better than to sit on comfortable chair. Others disagree. To know how to sit appropriately is better than to know on what you sit for tow reasons.     \r\n	First and foremost, there are many periorities while we work, but the most important periority is our health. The good position for your sitting is keep you healthier. Imagine your self that you work in an office for more than 8 hours as a manager in big company and everday you have to read your company progress and meet with important businessmen; the most thing you do while working is sitting on a chair to manage your issues. So we should keep our body move  easily and sit in correct position. There are many problem that caused by wrong sitting for long time such as poor blood circulation and high fluid build-up in the lower part of our boddies(Fisher "The Science").  As a result we should learn to sit healthier at the work because  the comfortable positions relative to comfortable feeling while we  work like pleasure, relaxation, softness. For example,  there is study of chair in 1997 fo by two researchers, Helander and Zhang, stated  that comfort and discomfor position of sitting; discomfort due to the design of the chair that people expressed their feeling in tired pain and also comfort due to the technique of sitting. These two researchers showed that two terms are depending on person habits, the kind of working, and the period of time working Fisher "The Science").          \r\n	Furthermore, if you have luxury chair with soft foam, nice leather, remote control for adjusting the chair position, and you sit on it for most of the day with wrong position. The expensive chair with wrong position of sitting that is westing money.  Many chairs companies are earning a lot of money because people think that good chair means good for their health. For instance, ReGenration are offering chair with arm from $676 and more, while the normal chair starts from $540 and up(Berlin "Sitting In"). The cost of ''healthy chair'' is ridiculous and that money should spent on other things to develop the compay. If a company have a hundred emploees that meant they should spent at least about $54,000 and more just for chairs. Some peole are working inside the offices and out side that demand th provide fancy chairs everywhere. Moreover, there are universities have more than 500,000 students should the universities provide that number of ''healthy chair'' , they can do that and may be increasing the tuition. These examples clearly show that knowing how to sit better than spending money to buy expensive chairs.     \r\n	To sum up, good sitting while we work not only save our health from hadr problems that prevent us from working any more, but also save our money that we are woking to earn it for good life. The suitable position of sitting makes you feel better and do your work in the best way. We should teach our childrenat at the schools how to sit appropriately to save their mony and health.

Therefore, the feeling when you are seated is rather essential, which will impact your working efficiency and achievement. Sitting properly is more important than the design of chairs considering the impression left in other''s minds and prevent sitting from detrimenting our health.\r\n	To begin with, a elegant siting posture can leave a good impression in people''s minds. In 1884,  the scientist Staffel raised  a sitting posture that required us to  keep our trunk, neck, and neck in a straight way (Fisher "The Science"). This posture has been universally recognized by people from all social classes more than 100 years. When you are working, leaders may come to inspect; if you are found curving your body with your legs crossed, you may be thought to be as a careless and casual person. Things can really happen like this because we are effected by the sterotype that sitting behavior can reflect people''s attitude. Sitting well means a tenacious attitude and energetic personality.\r\n	Besides, sitting all day can really do harm to our health because it block the circulation of blood. Therefore, you shouldn''t sit still for a long time, what you need to do is to move now and than such as strech your body or move your neck up and down. These sitting behavior not only can relieve your tireness but also reshape a straight body. What''s more, sitting for a long time in a proper way will stimulate us to develop a elegant sitting habit, which really makes a difference to our lives. For example, when you are in other places except working offices, sitting well also reflect your personal quality.\r\n	Berlin stateds that office chairs can decrease your spirit when working ("Sitting in"). But if someone lack of passion of working no matter how comfortable the chair is, he/she won''t concentren on working. In addition, the ReGeneration that he refers to is too expensive; thus, it''s impossible to carry out in real offices. Foremore, he also ignores our adaption to the environment. Due to the surprising adaption of our body, it''s hard to feel really uncomfortable (Fisher, "The science"). Only when we are seated for a long time will we feel tired.\r\n	In conclusion, a good sitting behavior is more essential than what to sit on due to its influence in impression and health. Indeed, I hold the view that we should stand up now and then to relax ourselves. After all, sitting all the time can really lead to many problem like obesity and blood disease.

Especially when you are going to be sitting in the same place for a long time, like when working in the office. Because not doing that may lead to some serious back problems that will affect our bodies in the long-term. Also, we have to consider some other factors when we sit. Which are, how comfortable the chair is? Does it support our backs? And whether or not the chairs that we are sitting on flexible, that allows us to move and stretch our bodies easily? Becasue changing the position that we are in is very important and it is demanded by our bodies. Considering all those factors, we must expand our knowledge of how should we sit. This essay will talk about the proper ways to sit on the chair and why we should change our postures often.\r\n\r\n     First of all, choosing the best way to sit on a chair is neccessary and it will benefit your body, especially your back. Morover, we should pay a full attention of how long we have been sitting in the same position. Because this is very serious issue, and if we don''t have enough knowledge of how we should sit, and how important is is to change our sitting postures, we may face some health problems. For example: a disorder in the circulation of the blood, (Fisher). That is why we should have our legs lifted up after sitting or standing for a long time without any movement. There was a popular idea about the proper and healthy style of sitting, which was "healthy sitting is sitting upright". But in 1884, a study done by Staffel advised that we should be sitting with a stright posture of our trunk, neck and head. Staffels''s theory was even more popular because it was accepted by everyone. But what was wrong about his idea is that he didn''t encounter the fact that sitting in the same position for a very long time would lead to some health issues as we mentioned before. Furthermore, our bodies are likely to change their posture every then and while, which will lead us to the next point of this essay.\r\n\r\n      In addition, considering what we should be sitting on is another significant aspect. Having an excellent-quality chair that support our backs and necks and allows us change our bodies'' postures without the need of standing is very important. Although it is important for us to stand up and have a short walk to make a kind of refreshment to the blood circulation and to avoid any fluids that may settle in a specific area of our bodies, some workers are too busy to waist a second in doing that. For example: imagine that you are the manager of a company and you are thinking of doing a big risky deal with another company, you will never notice the time that you spend on that computer calculating the possilities of winning and losing. Here comse the role of that good chair that has a curved back to help you support your spine and makes it easy to you to lean your back which would help you to keep your muscles relaxed, (Berlin).\r\n\r\n      In conclusion, sitting in the right position will keep us healthy and will save us form many back and spinal problems.\r\nMoreover, there are many factors to help us feel comfortable while sitting on the chairs for a long time periods and those foctors depend on that person himself. For instance: the furniture, the tools of the computer and the place of working. So, everyone should find what is more suitable and more comfortable to go with. Also, despite how much we are busy working on a computer and in spite of how comfortable and flexible our chairs are, we must change our postures by standing up, walking around every while.

Once hunters or berry-pickers in long times ago, the human race now, mostly, works at office or places which requier people to sit for a while over their work day. Although working inside of a good office, which migh havea  good articitial temperature and some another benefits, seems be a good idea. People who work in such places are facing problems related to body posture since inside-work have been populatized around the middle of the Twetieh century (Fisher, 2000). The issue is rolling over in our normal days harming our backs and causing uncomfortable consequences thus people need to decide about a solution for this. Though people have, in general, the same posture in sitting upon a chair they have different jobs and perhaps some of them requeres more time sitting or not. Therefore employers and employs should care more about in what kind of sit are they sitting due to people have different body shape and work time. \r\n	People have different body shapes, some people might be taller even weighter than the others, thus the posture in sitting shall be adequadaly formed for every single person. Factores like furniture, computer equipment and the environment at the work place should be rethinking for fit adequadely each person (Fisher, 2000). Having an uncomfortable position and staying sitting for many hour a day can lead people''s body to problems such as "poor blood circulation and too much fluid build-up in the lower legs" (Fisher, 2000). A good chair shall be able to make adjustments to form a better condition for the profissinal who would be sitting upon it for some time in work days. Berlin reports a good example of chair for work places - The ReGeneration - which is more compact, and less expensive. It brand migh be not the best one, or maybe it is, but people should care about differences between them by the time whem they are buying sits. For example, bosses should previosly know that they would have differente people working at their offices so sits which would fit their body form and conditions should be chose viewing a better employ''s healthy condictions. \r\n	Sitting form aside, people have different schedule and work type. Some of them might work most of the time standing up or sitting down. Thus, sits should be considered also for a different work time. To illustrade it let us think about a person who works serving beverages at a bar, they do not need a large comfortable chair as a computer''s programmer needs. As though Berlin reports that every reputable source advises spend more time standing up and moving around than stay sitting; everyone, it does not matter which kind of job people have, should have a time to stand up and move at least a little bit. Technics like that have been implemented at companies and schools where for some time-breaks students and workers stand up and have some time moving, even doing some kind of muscles exercices. It could help people healthy prevent from simptons previosly reported by David Fisher in his article. \r\n	In conclusion, people have different life style and work time thus health is an import subject for every one thinks about. Although today people are working sitting than ever before, aspects as people body shape and work time are crucial to determine a good sit to them that would fit their daily necessity as worker. Moreover, employs and employers need to think that spending money in a good sit is not wasting money for a phony propouse. People need to investe a good money, how much it would be necessary, to buy a good and comfortable chair to them due to investing money in a good sit is investing money in their own healthy and produtivite.

And the there were moments that me and my cousins had I fight because a chair, my grandmother chair. This chair was so comfortable that is impossible do not like staying sit there. But what was strange is that my grandmother does not like this chair , and once she said that this chair make her feel discomfortable. I saw she sit others chair,which for me in that moment these chairs looks like totally discomfortable. Year after that  I realize that the concept of chair is different to everyone and  what is really matter is feel comfortable. So  as a result I think that have a good chair ,which is perfect for your size and your body, is better  for your health than the way that you sit. Because the best is make feel comfortable and relaxing, even if the this kind of chair is expensive.\r\n	Currently there are many theories about the best way to sit  and many people try to sit in a good position. For sure this started after "the scientist staffel published his theories about proper "healthy" siiting postures. He recommended a straight posture of the trunk,neck, and head, similar to the desired back posture when standing erect" (Fisher,David. "Science of Sitting"). After that what the people think about a healthy sitting changes a lot, many teachers and doctors started to say that we have to sit in a erect way. But almost all the time the erect way of sitting is so discomfortable and many people begins to think about it. They conclude that the best way of sitting is when you feel more comfortable and relaxing. Consequently, the theories about the way that you sit related to your healthy lose their power and a new study came, this study is called the study of chairs and what this study say is that the  chairs really matter  and can make us comfortable or not, it''s depends of the kind of chair. The study also said that have to had differents chair for person, in other words it''s mean that chair is personal. And it''s because people have differents sizes and differents way to sit. For example if you buy a wrong chair, this chair can provide a the oposite of relaxing , can make you feel more tired. That is bad for your life style. \r\n	An ideal chair is a chair which make you more relaxing, which provide support  and make you well. Is this kind of chair that we need to looking for ,even if this chair were expensive, we have to think what is better for our body and for all life . So buy a chair, which is perfect to your body is a investiment, and in this case does not matter the price (Berlin, James. " Sitting In"). You just have to think how good will be you sitting in a chair, which was made for you. Because the chair is personal  and depends  what is your lifesytle, how you sit in a chair, and also depends of your size. For example the people who worked in offices they usually spent part of the day sitting a chair and every person there have differents style, so if the company buy a regular chair for every person what will happen is that many of these people will not like the chair, will feel stressful and will not work well . Is because of this that you have to find a perfect chair, even if this one is expensive.\r\n	So I conclude that  have a good chair that make you relaxing is more important to the healthy than the way that you sit. And it''s because, even if we sit erect we will feel discomfortable. So one thing who make us discomfortable is not so good to our healthy. And other important thing is buy a chair who make you well, it''s can be a expensive chair does not matter. You have to buy one chair perfect to your size and your style. \r\n	', '00:00:00', '2.5', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '11.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '12.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.75', '2.00', '2.25', '2.00', '11.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Human should use the right posture when they are sitting at work or at home. Right way to sit is obvious to every one because all people have known it either from their parents or anyone around them. All people should understand the proper way to sit to protect themseleves from illness. Choosing a comfortable chair is the best solution for this problem which is  a long sitting period. The right decision in this situation is depened on how should most people understand about their health in comparison with spending their money.\r\n      First and foremost, people should consider what is benefit to their health. The way of siting is effecting on human health. For example, when students had taken a test for five hours long while he is sitting in uncomfortable position, this situation could be endedwitj severe pain in their back, and all this pain will transported to their brain and might effect their answers in the test. According to Fisher, "furnture should allow for body movements and various postures," Fisher is surely right that the chair which people sit on, is very important because,as he may not be aware of that, recent studies have shown that people restness on their chair will reflect on their body and mind. Sitting for a long period of time might effect their spinal cord and vertibrate. Changing in people postures while they are sitting is allowing them to minimizes the presure on their spinal cord. Fisher views, " poor blood circulation and too much fluid build-up in the lower legs," The auther emphsizes the problem that might happened to human body if he sits for a long time. The situation of the workers is different from the situation of the students in the test, for this causes, scientist recommended a proper sitting postures, in comfotable chair. which is " sitting upright" and as well as standing from period to anther to avoid health problem.\r\n     Second, saving money is the reason beyound human being working, but this is not diffecult issue in comparision with their health. For instance, if anyone lives with health problems, his or her life will be misrible because he will not be able to have a fun time with all his pain. According to Berlin, " Almost half of each ReGeneration is made from recycled materials."  Berlin claims that company and people hould consider about the material which made the chair in order to recycle them. But people do not need him to tell them that, anyone familiar with recycling had known that, The most important issue, not the cost of the chair or the material had made of, is the comfortablity of the chair. The idea of having a good chair is not enough at all the changing in the position of the body is the most value thing. As Berlin mentions," as my doctor tells me I should be doing all the time while at my desk,"  The posture of the body is what allowing people to relax in the same time they are working. Misconcerend about the model of the chair an the company which made it is a cloud in most people mind, and it will desappeare when they use the \r\n     In conclusion, people should always think about their health ond ignore the idea of saving is the huge reason of their lives. The point here- that healthy sitting is the most proper issue- should interest those who are thinking about their health. Beyound this limiled audience, howevere, this point should speak to those who cares about the larger issue of next generation behavior. \r\n         ', '00:00:00', '2.0', '2.0', '1.5', '2.0', '1.0', '8.5', '1.5', '2.0', '2.0', '1.5', '1.5', '8.5', '2.5', '2.0', '1.5', '1.5', '1.5', '9.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.75', '2.00', '1.75', '1.75', '1.25', '8.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Sometimes we join an enviroment that shows us situations that we don''t have knowleadge. Once, I worked with a company that required from me a work that I was spending 6 hours of my day sat on a chair, making calls. Seems to be an easy environment to work with but during that time, I had known about consequences that could change my working style. While working, I had had a team that was being paying to look for the perfect environment to get the best posture and our posture.\r\n	In an office environment, the furniture given for us must support us during the time that we are working. There are a huge team behind the design of what is the best furniture for a person spend his hours working sitting on a chair. The human body is not equally the same, it requires differentes styles of necessity. In the company, the team responsible for me, had analyzed the quality of the chair that I spent sat. They had the goal of give me the perfect chair for my kind of body and the way that I sit. In the article called "Sitting in", Berlin report that " a person should work in a comfortable and healthy position with lean back slightly and the curved back supporting our spine". Berlin proves us that there are companies that are responsible for support the life of a worker focusing in the furniture that he needs.\r\n	During the moment that I spent 6 hours sat on a chair, I had had the concern that I should be worried all the time with my posture. Every morning a team of phisioterapists had came in our break to focus in our healthy. The goal of them were to work in the areas of our body that can cause us problems when it is not being used. Fisher reports in his articled called "The Science of Siting" that "sitting or standing for extended periods is uncomfortable and leads to many problems, such as poor blood circulation and too much fluid build-up in the lower legs. In today''s world there are laws that benefit the workers that works in that circustances. If the company don''t have a team working for their workers, it can lead to the court. \r\n	Thus, today''s century is not like the ancient times. People have the knowleagde of what people have to deal in their work and what can lead it. After my experience in that specific job, I came curious about the rules and what a specialist person in that area should know and study to be ready for that responsability. I knew that, like most of things, a single function is not enough to get the best results. For example, to get the perfect product in a company that products ketchup, we need of primary material, specialists people from maketing, research and development, production, selling, and etc. With all people together we can get a great product. Like a ketchup company, the office environment deal with a daily problem that require a big team that study and have knowleadge about what is right for us. At the same time that we have to focus on how we sit and our posture, we have to be aware about the furniture that is supporting us and it involves serveral people behind it to get the aproppriate work environment.\r\n ', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.0', '2.0', '1.0', '2.5', '6.5', '1.0', '1.0', '1.5', '1.5', '1.5', '6.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.00', '1.00', '1.75', '1.25', '2.00', '7.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Some jobs, such as driver, banker, manager among others workers need to spend many hours sitting. This situation can develop pain on the back, discomfort and poor blood circulation. The best way to change these problems is chose a appropriate chair to addapt adequately on the body. \r\n	In stores are easy to find chairs with different characteristics as format, materials, color, length among others. In the same way, each person has her unique body, some are fat and tall while others one are short and skin. The shape of body related with the shape of the chair can be the best combination to make a person comfortable. In The Science of Sitting, David Fisher says that furnitures can be discomfortable if a person choose a wrong size and can cause pain on her body (Fisher). A worker, who has a good body position, can not stay sitting for many hours in an imcompatible chair for his body without feeling discomfort. This condition make a worker feelings bad. The way to a worker get comfort when he has to sit for a long period is using a chair compatible with his body.\r\n	The material and shape of the furniture are essential to make it comfortable to sit. Some furnitures do not give good positions to someone sit. However, it possible find chairs with good design that can be comfortable to many peple. For example, in Sitting In, James Berlin says about a test made with some workers with different sizes and shapes using the same chair, and everyone found a good position to sit (James). James point out that is better to use a good furniture than have a good posture, because a good furniture can be adequade to many workers.\r\n	Furnitures with the best mechanics have capacity to give comfort to people. Using adequates chairs is possible to stay sitting for many hours without problems or discomfort. However, workers need to have good posture even they have compatible chairs.

As the workers have to do their jobs very well, they should have a good inveronment in their workstation. One of the most important factors in the workstations is what the workers sitting on in other words the chair. It is important for the workers to sit on a comfortable chair in the workstations in order to make them feel comfort and to maintain the health of their bodys in good condition.\r\n	What the workers sit on inside the workstation is very important because it makes them feel comfort with the work and , as a result, they will be more productive. Despite the fact that the standing is too important for human body, sitting makes the worker less tiring in their work and make them able to continue do their jobs with full activity. In his article about the science of sitting, Davied Fisher point out that sitting makes the worker feel less tiring much more than standing because fewer number of muscles will move which makes the body more stable (Fisher). Therefore, what we actually need as a workers in the workstations is a comfortable chair that makes our body feel comfort because what we really use in thye work is our brain in addition to some parts of our bodies. Therefore, if our body feel good our maind will work good. As a result, and because of the importance of these subject, researchers are became more interested in the design of the chair to be more comfort to the user. Helander and Zhang made a research about the design of the chair. They made a study over many people to test the differents positions of the chair in order to find the perfect positions for the chair (Fisher). Indeed, in order to make the worker more productive they should feel comfort with what they sit on in the work\r\n	The health of workers bodies is another important factor that should be take into account. Most body problems are came from the differents activities that the workers do in their jobs. Therefore, in order to maintain their bodies in a good health they should have a good condition in their work. In his article about the sitting, James Berlin says that people who sit on a comfort chair have to spending time standing and what is recomanded is between standing and sitting is 70 to 30 split (Berlin). In fact that is not necessary becouse this flactuation between sitting and standing will creat many health probles (Berlin). In fact, that not true because change in activity will make the body feel instable. Fisher argues that sitting and standing for differents periods of time makes the workers feel uncomfort and it makes a lot of health problems like the accumlation of blood in the lower part of legs and not right blood circulation (Fisher). Therefore, instaid of moving and sitting, which is not healthy habites, sitting on a comfort chair is more healthy. Going with the fact that our bodies need to move from time to time therefore chairs should be movable and adjustable to fit the regular activity of our bodies. Consequently, many manufactures are making their products of chairs movable in different directions and adjustable. Even though some chairs cost alot of money because of their facilites or the material that made from as Berlin says, there are alot of cheap and comfort chairs that good for health.  \r\n	  Workers should have a good place, chair, to sit on in order to feel comfort that makes them more productive, and to keep their body healthier. In fact, the vast majority of workers are working in office work therefore they need to spend their time in their disks.

The modern Offices are furnitued by the desire of office employees. Some of them are desinged without chairs to stand while working and other offices are provided with chairs to sit on them. These two ways of working depend on ecah person and how he or she feels comfortable during work time. Not all people care about what are they sitting on while working. But employees should sit on a flexible chair because it make them feel comfortable during work time and it can be adjusted.\r\n	The best chair that employees should use during work time is a flexible chair, which make them feel comfortable. Some people say that it is not important to feel comfort during work time and that is wrong. Msot employees are doing some critical jobs that require them to feel comfort. In addition, most workers preferd to do their works in a comfortable way. The flexible chair can provide the workers or the employees with a good position of sitting. Some employees do some works that could make them feel tired and exhausted. No doubt the human body always look for the best chair or the best way to sit on at working. Moreover, some employees stay at work for a long time, which make them feel uncomfortable with their job and even on what they sit on. The modern offices provide employees with a flexible chair that can help them to avoid like these situations. It is also considered unhelathy for huamn body to sit on any chair while working, espicially for those who work for a long time. Although the body can adapt quickely with the chair to feel comfortable, but not all people have this ability to adapt easly and quickly, espichally an old workers. Undoubtedly, feeling comfortable while sitting depends on the pesron and how his comfort is connected with his feelings, pleasure, relaxations and many other factors(Fisher 27-28). By using a flexible chair, employees will feel comfortable with their jobs.\r\n	The other resaon of using flexible chair is because flexible chair can be adjusted and moved to fit the human body. It is considered one of the most imporant office furnitue that allows the body to move and change in various ways. There are many bottons on the chair allow the person to adjust the chair as what he want and feel comfort. In his article about Sitting In, James says that the person can adjust the chair and move it up and down by using some optional lumbar support that is loacted on the back of the chair. He also says that the chair, a flexible chair,allows the person to to keep his body muscles, espicially back muscles, realxed without having any pains. Staying centered on the chair without movement can lead to some health problems like backache or pain in muscles. But with a flexible chair, the proportion of having some health problem can be reduced. What is more is that people who do not sit on flexible chair suffer from some health problems, because they are not able to adjust their chair, which means thay sit on a chiar with a wrong size that dose not fit their back. Human body wants to change the sitting way and to move around at least on the chair. That can be found by using a flexible chair.\r\n	Overall, chair users, employees, workers and so on, should sit on a flexible chairs. Not only because a flexible chair can make them feel comfortable during work time, but also it can be adjusted to fit their body.No doubt human always look for the best things to do or to have.

Thus, there are two main aspects that should be consedered, before sitting on a chair, which are time that will be spent on chair and the perfect way of sitting on a chair.\r\n	Sitting on a chair for a perod of time like a couble of mimutes doesn''t effect human body because the blod cycle will be weak during the session and back for normal after he or she stand up. But sitting for an hours, this difenatlly will hurm human body and  fewer muscles normally required to be interacted during the sitting. (Fisher "The Science of"). On the same atricle, he said there any many theories on the subject of the best way of sitting. Moreover, the sitting is linked to comfort for instance, when you are tooking to somebody, sometime use term relax in steed of sit, as common use for this word because sitting normally takes time longger than standing and based on the article the concept of comfort, on term of sitting time, demonstrats alots of meaning such as rest, pleasure and relaxation. Essenstially, the design of offices, labs or what ever  are based on many factors and should be sutabled for  people according to the same article. In addition, the design also effect sitting time, for example Macdonalds designed to be short time sitting using red and yellow colors.\r\n	Another aspect that should me considered before sitting on chair is how to sit? or what is the best way for sitting? Some of the chairs are flixable designed and the person who is sitting can easily adjust the chair like up down or back forward. Accourding to the Berlin " My favorite bit of adjustment, however, is the optional lumbar support found on the back of my chair" ("Sitting In"). Those features are very important and should be taked on account if you are buying a new chair. The relationships between our chairs and us must be wonderful because we are sitting on our chairs many times. On the same page, there are many poeple, who have a back problem because of the way of sitting. Now days, people are spending like ten hours surffing the internet and later on when he or she on will gig\r\n	In summary, chair is an object, but it has a lot of things. There are many articles that express how the chair harm people, therefore, it is ethicle to about two main questions before you buy a chair, which are how much time you will spend on a chair and what is the perfect way to sit on chair.

Chair is the most common furniture in our life and has become comforter since it was created. As well, the chair has evolved into many types to meet people''s flavor. Some chairs are made of wooden, the others are made of aluminum or the other materials. However, if we choose the chair which dose not fit to us or circumstance, the chair will become to useless furniture. How choose the chaire should be considered for each person because people''s size of body, position when they sit on the chair are different, and sometimes chair require the useage of specific purpose. \r\n	Our size and type of body are so different that we could not find perfect chair which serves comfort to everybody. For example, when I was young, my height of body was less than average. So I need to find small chair and desk for me whenever I move to next grade. David Fisher says in his article about the science of sitting that our shape of body is different, so chair should allow people to adjust its height or angle. As his article, because the chair cannot give comfort to everyone, people need to find fit chair. James berlin also describes in his article difference of shape body, resulting in defferent preference of chair. He compare his height to his co-workers'' height, and it makes different choice of chiar. In this article, the author says that chair should be chosen with considering user''s body characteristic.  \r\n	the other good reason is our different posture. people grow up in different circumstance, resulting in different posture or habit of sitting. Around us, we can notice many people whose posture is unique such as leaning one side of chair or one shoulder hunches. For them, these postures are their physical preferneces. Fisher also described that people''s different physical preference and work circumstance make different posture when they sit on chairs. Thus, the chairs are limmited to accept all of different their posture. people should consider their posture when they choose the chair.\r\n	In contrast, some people emphasize "healthy" sitting postures. Fisher quotes the Scientist Staffle''s theories about siiting postures. Staffle introduce the straight posture as "healthy" posture. this theory had convinced many people, so it was accepted by many people. However, fisher show his adverse opinion with his theory becasue it is very difficult to maintain this posture for a long time and it leads side effect, such as poor blood circulation. As well, pursuit of this posture is not rest. it is the extra task for people. people might say that our body is adaptive, so making the chair which makes people''s proper posture is reasonable. However, decision of good posture is impossible because of differnece of our shape of body and physical preference that is described above. \r\n	Sometimes, people use chair not only comfort, but also for specific reasons. For example, the chair which is used in work place, such as assembly line or consrtuction has different purpose. In this case, people focous on safety than comfort when they produce the chair. As well, these work circumstance might require people to change their sitting position that people prefer when they sit on the chair to prevent unpredicted accidents. This specific purpose of chair shows how choice of chair is important.  \r\n	As the good reasons, choice of fit chair should be considered. With required long time on the chair in school or work places, people should rethink of proper chair for them and invest chair for their life. If people choose the proper chair by considering different characteristics, they can take rest for long time on the chair or perform work effectively.

As a result, more and more workers changed the way that they used from standing at work to sitting in the offices. Since people used chairs for working, they have already been accustomed to sit on the chairs because sitting is a much less triing posture than standing. While spending a lot of time on unfitable chairs is not a good alternative for people to choose because bad chairs is harmful to people''s bodies. Sometimes the bad chairs will make the worker in pain.  I think, people should use special chairs because they are healthy, comfortable.\r\n	Among then, the most important thing is that people should use special chairs which can keep people healthy. Nowadays, a number of people will work in the offices and use chairs all the day. When the chairs are not fitable, it will cause a lot of problem such as poor blood circulation and making people''s legs uncomforanle. For instance, my mother is a businesswoman. Everyday, she would spend more than 8 hours sitting on the chair in front of the computer because she needs to talk with partners though the computer. Everyday when she finishes the work, I will hear she saies that there is a lot of pain in her back and neck; sometime when she stands up, her eyes just can see dark for a while. As Berlin said, people should buy the best chair that they can afford because a good chair can allow they to keep their back muscles relaxed and the curved back can still support them to work (Berlin "Sitting in"). The workers should buy the best chair that they can buy because they will use chairs more than 7 hours everyday. If the workers do not care about their backs, when they become older, they will find that there is a lot pain in their backs especially when they go to sleep at night. Thus, people should use special chairs in order to keep healthey.\r\n	In addition, special chairs can support the workers a good posture that makes them comfortable when they are working. As Fisher said,discomfort is expressed in such terms as feeling stiff, tired and in pain while comfort is associated with feelings of well-being, relaxation and rest (Fisher "The Science of Sitting"). Although a good chair will cost a lot of money, it is good for people''s health. Depending on one''s body type and size, physical preferences and work activities, a special chair will adjust itself such as moving the zipper up and down. A special chair is capable of making people feel like they are lying on the beds. Consequently, the workers can work faster and faster. They will be more effective because they do not have to worry about their backs and they can use any posture that they want. Thus, people should use special chairs because only then will they be able to work in comfort.\r\n	To sum up, an ergonomically-designed office depends on many factors such as the enviroment, computer equipment and especially a good chair. People should use special chairs because they can keep workers healthy and make them more comfortable. In addition, there is advice for the workers who work in the offices that they should not only depend on special chairs. Sometimes the workers should do excise by using their backs or necks every hour.

Is it bothering you to sit on chair for long time? If so, what are the main things that bothering or hurting you while stitting? It is hard to say how much time we spending sitting on shair because we sit on chair for many thing in our lives, such as: studying, watching TV, play Crads..etc  In fact, most of workers and students spend most of their time sitting on chairs. Sitting for lonf time on uncomfortable chair may have a bad effect on human body. Therefore, all manufactures should design chairs that fit with workers and students needed to help them to stay healthy and be more productivity.\r\n	  First of all, sitting for long period of time has negative impact on human body. In fact, sitting for long time makes the person feels uncomfortable and it considered as the main reason for a lot health issues, to illustrate: poor blood criculation and too much fluid build-up in the lower legs ( Fisher " The Science of"). Equally important, when student sit for long time without moving, it will make the student do not think deeply and have clear mind because they would be thinking on the uncomfortable chair more than the subjects that they focus on ( Fisher " The Science of"). Therefore, all education places such as, schools, clollages, libraries...etc Should use the Knoll ReGeneration chairs because it fits with students and it has really comfortable seats that help students to focus more on study. Also, it is very light so students can move easly. Lastly, it is also vrey cheap comparing with the other chairs, so it is more benefits and less money (Berlin " Sitting In" ).\r\n	Second of all, bad chair might has nigative influences on the economy. when workers have uncomfortable chairs that do not move and have bad seats, they will be less productivity because they will have to stand a lot to grab papre and moving around to finish their work. Therefore, workers will spend less time on work, which will lead to take a long time to finish their work and that means the manufatures will produce less number of products  and gonernments will finish less work because of chair.\r\nNotwithstanding, if compnies and manufatures use the Knoll ReGeneration chair they will provide their workers with a good chairs that helps them to move around because it has wheels. Also, there are some short workers that they need a special chairs, Therefore," Knoll ReGeneration has beneath the seat are levers you''d expect for adjusting the hight and depth, and for locking in the reclining mechanis" ( Berlin " Sitting In").\r\n\r\n	According to James Berlin in " Sitting In", telling the readers that lean back slightly while sitting is enough to protect the human body from have a poor health if he sits for long time. I disagree with the writer because leaning back only does not move all human muscles especially the legs. Therefore, If the just leang back without standing while sitting for long time he might have a poor blood circulation and too much fluid build-up in the lower legs. Also, the healthiest way to sit is sit straight posture of the trunk, neck, and head and do not lean to much ( Fashir " The Science of" ).\r\n	In summary, chair is more imporatant than how we sit because it un suitable chair has a negative impacts on our health. Equally important, having a bad chair make the person less productivity in work and study.    \r\n	', '00:00:00', '2.5', '1.5', '1.5', '2.0', '1.5', '9.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '1.5', '11.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.00', '1.75', '2.25', '1.50', '10.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, '');

Well, the way that people sit can be very important for the workers, because if the person comfortable, he will use all of his talent in many ways and produce, which can help himself and his co-workers to develp and improve. The key word of how people sit is comfort. However, the way that people sit can be more than effective as some people imagine, and is not important to focus on the thing that the person sit on, because the definition of comfort is different for each person and some people cannot aford to buy comfortable chairs.    \r\n     First, the definition of comfort or relaxation is one fundemental definition. In the article "The science of sitting" defines, "Comfort when sitting is associated with feelings of well - being, support, safety,pleasure, relaxation, rest, warmth, softness, and spaciousness."(Fisher27-28). Although many people attend to shape this definition and to change it for what it is suitable for them, so technecally everyone has different definition of comfort. For example, some people they feel comfortable when htey sit on the ground which is scientifically not a healthy option, but the surcumstances or the environment forced them to do this, and also forced them to adjust and adopt with this kind of situation. In addition, the shape of the person body can have a huge influence people from choosing the definition of comfort for . In the article "The science of sitting" explains, "There is general agreement that many postures may be comfortable (healthy, suitable, efficient, etc) for short periods, depending on one''s body type, physical preferences and work activities."(Fisher27-28). Many factors can change the person''s definition of comfort, and it it is related to how people while their working. \r\n     Second, as we know there is many poor people in the world, and unfortunatly they found comfortable chairs hard to afford. Well, this is how the world works, the healthy furniture is always expensive, beacause of the materials that use to produece them and the features that have. Furthermore, chairs in the past used to be an equipment that people just sit on, but nowadays, chairs has become a huge business, because of the development, some chairs can reach the price that people cannot imagine. In the article "Sitting on" informs, "The ReGenerations starts at $676 with arms, and $540 without."(Berlin). However, this prblem made people to reconsider about the thing that they will sit on and wether they want to be comfortable or not, because of the inane price of comfortable chairs. although, some people think that comfortable chairs worth to be affordable, but it should not be with unpredictable price, and also the companies that have offices, the workers always be the victum, because companies will not subsidize the offices with expensive comfortable chairs and they expect from the workers to work hard and develop the company.  \r\n     In conclusion, people should know their definition of comfort to increase their work efficiency, and also the chair companies should look after the people that cannot afford the expensive chairs. People work hard and become more happier if the furniture in general is designed to fulfil their needs.  In the article "The science of sitting" conclude that,"Modern design models for furniture need to incorporate the full range of body sizes and working postures among himans. Only then will we be able to work in comfort."(Fisher27-28).', '00:00:32', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.5', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '13.5', '3.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '12.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.50', '2.50', '2.75', '2.25', '12.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

People''s health depends on how they sit on the chair. Moreover, whan people know how to sit, they make their bodies comfortable. However, some people buy an expensive chair to be comfortable, but the problem is not in the chair; the issue depends on how people sit. For example, my father bought the last version of chair''s office, but he still has back pains. Then, he went to the doctor, and the doctor tought him the best way to sit on the chair. People should know how to sit on the chair to be healthy and comfortable.\r\n               On of the things that helps people to be healthy is: to know how to sit. In other waords, when people sit along time on the chair, that might cause health''s problems. For instance, my cousine works as a police officer, he sits on the chair without moving for a long time; now he has a back pain, because of the long sitting on the chair. According to Fisher said that sitting for a long period of time that cause other problems, like "poor blood circulation" and "too much fluid build-up in the lower legs" ("Science of Sitting"). Therfore, when people switch between sitting and standing, that helps a lot to refrech their bodies and minds. Also, it gives the body energy to work without getting back pain or other peoblems. Furthermore, The best way to sit is to keep trunk, neck, head and back straight, to avoid health''s problems ( Fisher "Science of Sitting"). Overall, when peole maintaine their health, that lead to make them comfortable. \r\n              Additionaly, when people know the right way to sit, that make them comfortable. Most workesr want to be comfotrable in their offices, because that give them the energy to complete their works. In additon, offices'' furniture should be apropriate for workers, to be comfortable. Also, it should be flexiable to let workers move where ever they want; because sitting for a long time makes workers not comfortable. For example, workers need chairs with good sizes and able to move freerly. Moreover, the environment of work affects people''s feelings. For instance, if the office''s equipments are not good, such as chairs and desktops, that make them lazy, and without passion to work. Currently, some offices have running machines, to let workers switch sitting. As a result, that give them energy to work, and make them comfortable.     \r\n             Some people might say that getting modern chairs helps to make people comfortable and healthy. However, some chairs made of materials that cause health''s problems, such as plastic. According to Berlin reported that most of modern chairs made of plastic and aluminum ("Sitting In"). In fact, these materials make people discomfortable, and that might cause back pain. Addtionaly, modern chairs are expensive, no one can get it, so people should know the right way to sit. \r\n              In coclusion, people should know how to sit on the right way to be healthy and comfortabe. Therfore, if people don''t know the right way to sit, that might cause health''s problems, and kind of powerless. Moreover, it makes people lazy and not comfortable to achieve their works. For instance, the design of the offices should be suitable, to let workers move where ever they want. All of these motivations make workers to work in a comfortable environment.

David Fisher, writing in his article, "The Science of Sitting," says that sitting for a long time on the chair uncomfortably can be reason for siveral healthy problems such as poor blood circulation and the lower leges will recive too much fluid bluild. Workers should understand the risks of sitting for a long time to avoide diseases. Moreover, one way to avoide diseases is to get some relax or short brake between time to time. During that breake workers should go out the office and make some excersise like wake under the san for three mints only to gave their bodys some movement. Human body need to have some movement from tiom to time to reactive the body (Fisher). Moving workers body can help workers also to refrsh their mind and retarnt to the job againe with full power.

Sitting becomes a vital part in people''s life because their need to sit on a chair everyday. Although some people say that they should fcous on what they sit on while working rather than how they sit, how they sit is more important than what they sit on while working. Here are two reason for people why they should know and find the way that they sit. Sitting all day will cause a lot of health problems, and also people do not like to cost plenty of money and time to deal with a problem of a chair so it is an excellent to find a suitable way to sit. \r\n	One the one hand, people prefer to find a comfortable chair in their workplace, and that means they can decrease healthy problems as many as they can. The word "comfort" play an important role in the finding process. In one article about the science of sitting, the author David Fisher says that "Sitting or standing still for extended periods is uncomfortantable and leads to many problems, such as poor blood circulation and too much fluid build-up in the lower legs." And also, he says that there are a lot of researchers such as Helander and Zhang they did a lot of studies of the chairs about the comfort and discomfort. David also says that chairs for people are a key design feature (The Science of Sitting). Due to the long period sitting, almost all the parts in people''s body will feel tired. And then, if they do not prrvide enough excises to adjust the long time sitting, they finnally will get fat. So, the first problem calls obesity.\r\n	Ont the other hand, people do not have time to think about what they sit on while working what chair they should buy if they are pretty busy. Personally, people do not like to spend a large amount of money to buy a high functions or flexibilities chair for their working in workplace. The boss is only one, and it is impossble for the boss to prepare all comfort and suitable chairs for his employees. Thus, people should know how to find a go way to sit, and not just depnd on the chair. They cannot chagre it. For example, people can put a alarm on their working table; if they sit a long time, the alarm will ringing. After that, people can do a small area walking on their offices, lobbies, restrooms. Or they can learn some relaxable actions through Internate or books. Learning to avoid long time sitting is a necessary lessen in people''s life even though they are very busy. According to an online article that was written by James Berlin, claims that a lot of researchers or reports say that sitting all day is a killer for human being, and also people may purchase a suitable chair which they can afford bucause a good chair is equl to a investiment for people (Sitting In). Therefore, a comfortable sitting way should be found.         \r\n	All in all, almost all people hate sitting a long time in the workplace everyday despite the fact that they have undergone a great deal of times when they were a student. They must bear it. So, now, people know that finding a comfortable and suitable way to sit becomes more and more important than looking for what people sit on.  Concentrating on adjust and organize personal time, putting both standing and sitting together in the working process are vital in the life.

Everybody at least once in your live heard someone trying to correct your posture of sitting or recommend someone to sit errect in order to correct the posicion of their back. They say that people that do it will save their back for the future avoiding painfull illnes. Despite some researchers concern about a specific standart of posture such like how you sit or what you sit on while working this article put most value in sitting with moviment and the individuals differences of each people to chose a adequate chair.\r\n	People usually don''t perceive that sitting errect is a painfull job and bring the same effects that sitting in a discomfortable position for some periods. I ussually went to church every sunday and spent 5 hours of service sitting. It is a struggling because you can stay 3 hours sitting with a erect posture and will feel much tired. In addiction the church''s furniture don''t have ane flexibitity and can''t be regulated making worse effects if you stay for long periods changing positions. For have a efficient chair it is necessary sitting with moviment as a way to reach the confortable and protection position of our bodys "Furniture should allow for body movements and various postures"(Fisher, David) suit the positions with adjustments that balance our spine for feel confortlabe and healthy in the  discomfortable sittuations as value to any furniture that wants to be adequate for people "Impressive is how the chair handles uncomfortable positions"(Berlin, James).\r\n	In fact every person is different. People usually born and grow up with their own characteristics such as spine more curved for right or for left or even much curved then normal that causes to the person make a treatment to correct their back. Other factor that influence any person is weight. When I was a trainee in a company there are differents kinds of people in the office and each one with a different weight or size. There are people obese, overweight and thin as me. However everybody feels confortable because the chairs are much flexible allowing a hundred percent of customization. Its necessary make any furniture be able to support the differents characteristis of humans "modern design models for furniture need to incorporate the full range of body sizes and working postures among humans"(Fisher, David) to make a furniture that can easily addapt for different people "I passed it around to a few ofiice-mates of different shapes and sizes...could also find a comfortable position in it"(Berlin, James) in order to construct a adequate chair that will keep healthy live for people when they get old minimizing the risks of have a several illnes in their back. \r\n	In conclusion it is necessary pay more attention in chose adequates chairs that provide a flexibiity in the individuals characteristis and to balance the moviment then just concern about how you sit or what you sit while working in order to reach a enought reply to keep people heathy sitting despite the posture or material.\r\n	', '00:00:03', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.5', '10.5', '2.5', '2.0', '1.5', '2.0', '1.0', '9.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.25', '2.00', '1.75', '2.00', '1.75', '9.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Before all paperworks were computerised, clerks had worked in staying positions, often moving from one place to another because of distances between different databases (Fisher "The Science of Sitting"). Today, we completely changed our working style dictated by the main host of modern office-computer. Sinse the times when people have begun working more sitting than standing, the question about the right position while sitting raised by many scientists. Scholars are solicitous about that specific discomfort and backache caused by sitting in one still position for a long time. Scientists and designers work over the problem how to sit better or how to make an ideal seat to sit better on it. In light of this dilemma, I think that is more important for people to develop their abilities in maintaining comparatively free movements while they are sitting that helps them to be independent from any kinds of seats and support their helth more effectively.\r\n	The close investigation of biomechanical science of human body indicates unrestricted sitting position with possibility to change poses friquently as healthful and natural. That is true because our body essentually designed to perform many functions starts to suffer in some longlasting stable positions. Live creatures need movements of those consists ous existance. Limiting activity, we hurt our body causing legs'' swelling, muscle pain, and even serious problem with vertebral columne. Quite recently, scientists applied a philosophical approach to the problem with choosing a comfortable position. They found that definitions of comfort and discomfort have been "partly overlaped" (Fisher "The Science of Sitting"). This conclusion underlines the crucial law of nature-where all notions are comparatevelly compartible. Even some comfortable position will be uncomfortable with the lapse of time because relaxation one groupe of muscles brings tension for the other one. Thus, absolute relaxation means absolute abcense of  muscle contructions, in other words-death.\r\n	The Idea to hold freedom of movement working at the desk stimulates many talented designers to construct an ideal, comfortable, and possibly biologically closer to human body chair. In "Sitting In", James Berlin is raptuously excited over this ideal chair. This is all from natural hipoallergical materials, supportive in any kind even not right position,and helpful in changing this position for more healthful. Berlin asserts that espesially useful an "optional lumbar support" which helps human spine periodical relaxation. However, additional adjastments require additional money. I like this chair directed by the author''s lauds, but the prise of it looks a little bit frightening. We all know how important physical development of young persons: they are spending a lot of time sittind while learning. Yourth is getting more vulnirable to fall as the victims of constant sittingbecouse they need movements to shape and develop muscles and bones in a proper way. However, our adolescents are often restricted in money. That is why, it is getting more important to develop ability to change pose sitting at desk. Once realizing necessity of movement, any person can be independent from sometimes useful but still artificial and limited mechanical comfort offered by some ideal chair. \r\n	Freedom of movements create evolutional progress. Freedom of positions while working definitelly would create healthy people. When someone feels free and comfortable, he or she can create interesting and fruitful thoughts, be successful. The lore of our nature should proceed in accordance with recent technical progress, vital agility shoul be balanced with electronical stiffness.

If this idea is true how were previous generation workers that did not have modern furniture in their work places and they were halthier and more productive than today people. They feel comfortable when they work. What is the secret behind behind their power. Definitely the power was not what kinds of chair they sit in but how they sit in and create a nice working environment with simple chairs they had. In my view what is more important is how to sit rather than what to sit in. \r\n\r\nThe first reasons that makes how to sit is more important that what to sit is creating nice environment to sit in. This environment does not related to how beautiful furnitures or chaires are, but how make ones self feel comforable. In one article from New York Times about the sitting in James Berlin says that he and his collegues feel nicely and more comfotable when they sit the whole day work in their chairs by just adjusment their simple chairs to fit with their size. He says also that the best and suitable chair is that the chair they can afford (B8). This support the idea that how to sit is more important than what to sit in because workers can create better and nice environment to work in with simple kinds of chair. Another atricle about sitting David Fisher says that the upright sitting is more crucial to worker people not the chairs themselves. How to sit when people work is more beneficual and productive thatn how chairs were design. some skeptic however say that people get tired and exhaustes and they need more sohpisticates chairs that are more comfotrable. That is probably true but  emploee sometimes get bored during working hours, but the reason behind that are not the the tools they sit in but because they are human and human get bored due everyday routine. \r\n\r\nAnother reason is human health. However, some scientists concern about the effect of sitting for long time during working hours on people health. In his article "The Science of Sitting." David Fisher says that scientests like Staffel has atheory about effect of sitting for long time on people organs such as their backs and necks and heads. He says that people need to more and circulate their blood in their body and relax their muscles (27. This idea is true, but it does not alone according to Fisher in his article the healthy issue is not only factor effect of study sitting. Comfotrable and effecient sitting are also imprtant factors. He say that there is a scale to classifiy chairs according to comfort from low comfort to more comfort (27). However, If this is true that what kind of chairs is important to the people health and people comfort. How about previous generation that did not have comfortable and modern design nevertheless, they live healthier and more effecient and comfortable with simple kinds of furniture.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, How to sit is more important than what to sit in because the impotant thing to feel better during working houres is to sit and creat comfortable environment to keep people still healthy they can movoe and stand and relax then sit again regardless what kinds of chair are.', '00:00:00', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '14.0', '2.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '3.0', '12.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.25', '3.00', '2.50', '2.50', '3.00', '13.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

After long journeys of job, sometimes after years, all these time may affect the employees life forever. According to Fisher, sitting for a long period of time can cause many health''s problems such as a deficiet in the blood circulation (Fisher "The science of Sitting"). So, what to do to minimize these problems in the workplace? What is the best to employees? Many years ago the scientists believed that the best to employees was make right theirs posture, but now we can say that a good chair to spend long hours sitting is a good way to avert future health porblems (Fisher "The Science of Sitting"). Even whether the people has a "right sitting", whit an unconfortable chair this will be a problem. For these reasons, the companies should embrace adequades chairs to employees because is the best alternative to avoid future health problems, is good to environment and are less expensive. 																				\r\n		We know that staying long hours sitting is unhealthy, but to stay sitting for long hours in an inadequate chair could be worse. A chair with the wrong size for example could be really unconfortable to the people. Further, it have to fit with the person''s body because each person are different (Fisher "The Science of Sitting"). A wrong chair, that don''t allow the body movement, can make the employees'' health more complicated. Sitting for a long time without move can cause high level of fluid build-up in the lower legs, for example (Fisher "The Science of Sitting"). Beside, the employee well-being are affected when they are sitting in a disconfortable chair. Is the employeers resposablity pay attetion in the employees necessitites and take care of their health in the work place and sometimes a small change as new more confortable chair could be the key for a enjoyable place to work.\r\n              Next, today the environmental responsabilities related with less abiental impacts have being discussed everywhere. So, all the companies should be part of these global changes and to invest in chair that could be easely recyclable and that cause less ambiental impact. Further, many people could think that a chair made of recycled materials could be unconfortable, but these chairs are flexible, confortable and able to put you in a healthy position (Berlin "Sitting In").  According to Berlin, a chair with about 50% of recycled materials, are more compact that a not made of recycled materials ("Sitting In"). So, when the companies choose the ecological chairs and when it is old and sent to trash, it will not cause a huge impact to environment when compared with a not made of recycled materials. For these reasons, do the right choice are good for everydody, including the environment.\r\n		Last one, the cost to produce an ecological chair is inferior when compared with the necessary to produce a normal chair. With low cost of production the final price of the product will be better to the companies. A chair made of recycled materials is lighter, more compact and consequently less expensive (Berlim "Sitting In"). Including the way how the chair is shipped is more economic, because what is shipped to the consumer is lighter and are inside of a compact box, as a result the delivered system is cheaper and cause less ambiental impact (Berlim "Sitting In"). Saving money is important for all companies that are looking for sucess, so choose the adequadete chair is an important step to achieve this objective.\r\n		To conclude, thinking about what we chose to spend hours sitting, even when we are in home working in front of the computer is an important issue. Be expose to health problems is a serious question and something which the employeers have to put especial attetion. An inadequated chair can cause to employees diseases and can condenate their lives forever. Even more, the well-being of everybody should be the priority for the employeers. Investing in chairs made of recycled materials could be the solution to the companies because they will save money, is confortable and fit with the employees'' body and help the environment with all theses results its sure that theses companies will be sucesseful in a next future.', '00:00:00', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '3.0', '3.0', '14.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '1.5', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '3.00', '2.50', '2.75', '2.25', '13.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

But, the dilema today is posture. Are you sitting correctly in your chair? Most people know they are not. However, it is difficult to know who is the principal cause of all the backs and posture problems, if it is how you sit or what you sit. In my oppinion this two can be responsible for posture and body problems. However, I may say that the problem with the chair it is not the chair itself, but the personal habits and wrong posture implied in this chair, this could be very difficult to change.\r\n	Sitting all day doesn''t seem very good for health. Several people that work behind computers, sitting in an office chair, complain that they have back injuries or disconfort in some part of the day. They are very concerned if someday it would implicate in more severe health problems. But, they are think that the real problem is the chair and don''t preocupate with what their behavior and posture can influenciate. The fact is that people know that exist several procidures and correct ways to sit. But, this correct ways means to follow unconfortable possitions. Because of that, they choose to don''t follow this rules. They can simply say that the enterprise don''t care about their health and confort, buying less expensive chairs and this is the cause of their pain. However, the fact is that the body can adapt to most chairs if the person has not back problems (Fisher 2000). In that way, it is presumible that people don''t acquire their back injuries because of the chairs properly, they acquire it sitting in wrong possitions.\r\n	If you ask someone that works in office if their chair is good you certainly can predict the answer. Most people would say that the chair is very bad and this is the cause of their posture problems and also probably blame their boss for not providing one decent chair. It is obvious that they could think that because their boss probably have a chair better and more expensive than their. But, if their discover that their boss have the same posture problem as theirs, their oppinion would change. The desk posture it and difficult problem to solve, the health position should be doing always (Berlin 2011). In fact, even if you could have the best chair possible and still sitting wrongly, the chance that you have the same disconfort is very high. Thus, it is more possible to believe that in this issue the real problem is not only the chair, it can contribute for the body problems, but the individual posture is a problem more likely to happen.\r\n	Thus, it is possible to conclude that chairs can be a factor that contributes to health problems. People should be more concerned with what their are sitting in all day and if it is comfortable for theim. However, the problem with chairs is easier to solve if comparated with people''s posture in the chairs. They should know that even more expensive chairs couldn''t not correct their posture problems. This not only depend that the chair they are using only in their work environment, but also in every chair they are sitting. For this reason, it is good to be aware with the kind of furniture is used in office, but it is also very importante to be alert with their behavior when using this equipments.

However, as a consequence of this increasing in the life quality of humans, some problems have also become part of their lifes. One of the most discussed problem currently is the noise pollution. This because, nowadays it is possible to identify noise polution''s levels by techonological devices and some people who had some demages in their ears are demonstrating the consequences of high exposition to lound sounds by their own experiences. In this way, some studies have been made and proved that pollution noise may demage the hearing abillity, mental processing and decrease the productivity of people (David, F.). On the other hand, some people prefer to listen music through out lound sound because it seems to be more fan and generate intreternment. Nevertheless, people should work to eliminate noise pollution because the exposing of lound sound for a long period cause hearing demage and affetc the human behavior.\r\n 	First of all, the principal issue which justify the necessity of human being to reduce the exposure to excessive sound is the hearing demage that it might cause. This because our ears are sensibles to a amoung of frequency which float between 20 Hz and 20 kHz and the intensity confortable supported is 90 dB (David, F.), thus if our ears were exposed to sound that are over of this characteristcs, the hearing abillitby could be affected. For example, companie''s employees who work in places that the sound exposure is intense for a long period of time such as build, iron and automotive companies, have hearing losses. Besides, the citie''s noisy also can damage the hearing abillity of the human. This because, people who lives near by huge avenues or airpots are exposes a large amoung of noisy all the time. Accoring to Fisher, " The sound produced by average of automibile is equivalent to 90 dB". It indicate that living next to places where the pollution noise happens frequently may cause pemanent hearing losses. Therefore, governamental departaments should work to reduce the levels of lound sound exposure for people in factories and cities though laws which force companies give for their employees hear protector and make acustic isolation structures more accessible for people who lives next to noise pollution. \r\n	Furthermore, the continuos exposure of high levels of lound sound for human beings cause changings in their behavior. This because, when people hear a lound sound for a long period of time they feel uncorfortablle and it generate irritability, tension and even agressive acts. For example, residents of Silver Spring complained about the noise pollution caused by buses at the Ride On bus depot because it happens all the time in the day, even in the night and in the morning, and it is over of limit stablished by Environmental Protection Agency (Berlin, J.) making them irritated. In addition, noise pollution may change the behavior of people while they are studying. According to Fisher, "[..] efficiency can be seriously affected by high noise levels and that fewer mistakes are tipically made when noise levels are reduced." It indicate that even the people can make some tasks hearing lound sounds, after some time of exposure the brain is affected and, consequently, the productivity decrease. In this way, it is necessary to respct silence times in places next to schools, universities and residential houses because the pollution noise makes bad influence in the human behavior decrasing their poductivity and putting down their life quality. Therefore, it should be created laws which determine a minimal distance of schools, universities and residential house that it would be allowed noise as a way to prevent people of this kind of pollution.\r\n	In conclusion, although some people like to listen  musics or watch a movies with out lound sounds, others sources of noise generation such as factories and automobilies may cause unconfortable feeling in the human ears and even cause hearing losses. As a consequence of this, the government should take care about noise and how this kind of pollution affect the life quality of the people. In this context, laws should be created to prevent people to high exposure of lound sounds through applying of technology to reduce the sources of noise, making easy the access of noise isolant material and stablishing a minimal distance of places which need quiet times.', '00:03:17', '2.5', '2.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '12.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '14.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.50', '3.00', '3.00', '2.00', '13.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Furthermore, is clearly that the noise polution is a problem in the 21st century, and this can damage people ear and well being, since the noise can be harmfull for population. David Fisher states that "Interruption of sleep by noise can cause people to become tense, irritable and resentful about the cause of the noise"(Fisher, 1) what means that this situation provide several negative effects. But, what can people do to decrease this problem? To answer this question is important to realize where the sound comes from. In fact, a large amount of noise pollution is generated by companies and industries that use equipaments which produce high sound and, also, by automobiles traffic. Hence, is necessary that industries stay distance for residencial areas and that they provide equipaments to protect workers from the noise. Also, is importante to incentive the population to go see doctors to get informations about the ear performance and, finally, decrease the quantity of automobiles on the street, making people using more public transportation instead of cars. Nevertheless, many people affirm that buses can generate a high quantity of noise compromising the well being. Therefore, actions to reduce noise pollution consist in the respect a distance between industry and comunities, incentive people do consultations with doctors and the use of public tranportation.\r\n      Firtly, a huge quantity of noise production comes from industries and this can affect either comunities which are near them. What happen is that some industries are build in nearby residential areas, even though with population desaproval and this is situation that can no accepted, since the communities are very affected. Thus is necessary respect a safe distance from comuniies areas and move industries for distance place analize the distance for the other that will be constructed. However, sometime is nopossible for the industry change the location and for them, that are unable to leave, is important that they do investments in the machine''s engineers making produce less noise. (Fisher, 1) agues "the best formula for reducing noise damage is for sound engineers to dampen as much noise as possible, preventing noise pollution at its source."(Fisher, 1) Also, workers who have a job is these places suffer with the high level sound. In the same article, Fisher says that "industrial noise causes actual damage to the hearing of laborers who suffer overxposure to loud sound in the workplace"(Fisher, 1) Thereby, is necessary that industries provide high quality products for them, like headsets, with the aim to minimize the problem and make the job as enjoyable as possible.\r\n     Secondly, people need the go to the doctors and make exams to analize the situation correlated with the noise that people have to handle in the daily. This can be helpful, since if thereis some problem, doctors ar able to work to solve the problem. Also, with this consults people can realize how much they are affected by the noise and try to avoid than, like for instance, if a person has been affcted by noise in the company, he/she can go to talk with the boss and ask for protection. Indeed the industries can give to the enemployees this service. Fisher affirm that "companies can also offer their workers consultations with doctors for annual hearing tests."(Fisher, 1) Thus, this tends to help people to reduce the changes of damage.\r\n     In fact, there are some public transportations like, buses for example, which can give to the population a big quantity of noise. James Berlin explains in his article how the noise pollution generated by bus affect a comunity that complains about it, and they can be negative from the ear health (Berlin, 1). Nonetheless, the noise caused by the buses engineers can be minimized, once the companies invest in this point, making them provide less noise pollution.\r\n     Finally, the noise caused by the automobiles is one of biggest problems, because they are for all part and can affect every people. Fisher explains that they produce a average equivalent to 90 dB and, in addition, he states that "exposure to noise in excess of 90 dB for eight hours in any twenty-four hours fo five days a week can lead to permanent hearing damage if exposure continues over a period of thirty to forty years."(Fisher, 1) What shows how dangerous can be the noise provided by cars, motobicycle, and so forth. Thus, is important that people use the public tranportations instead of private tranportations because, with this, the number of cars on the street decrease and, therefore, the noise. Is important to realize that a subway, for example has the ability to carry many people, what means less many cars on the street, and less noise because the number decrease and situations like traffic jams are minimized, making the use of buzzing unecessary. In addition, with people use more the public tranportation, the tranportations can get more money and, as a result, they are able to invest in the engineers performance, which will created sophisticated transports making the public transportations cause a lower sound. \r\n     Therefore, the noise is big problem that the humanity has been facing and is necessary actions to solve the problem.

With the distance from industries from houses, visinting doctors and the use of public tranportationsm, the negative effects caused by noise is decreased, providing people a high quality of life and the society a great development, since people do not have strees and bad conditions cause by umconfortable noise.

Although the desire to ended with all noise issues is a hard work and almost impossible, the population can''t not stay aware regarding this situation. When the  negative effects of noise pollution are discussed, it''s important to highlight the most significant of them such as the lost of part or totally hearing cognitive abillity and also the effects on humans capacity to be focused in a work environment.\r\n	As the time pass, people are increasing hearing loud musics for a long time and the first signals of damage are appearing. This type of noise is a concern involving children and teenagers who spend an amount of time using hearing devices. According to David Fisher, the author of the article entitled "Noise Pollution", there are some limits for humans to be exposured a lound sounds. Sounds levels above 120 dB (decibel, an way to measure the sound volume) are considered "dangerous and a helth hazard". Not only loud musics can be responsible for pepolpe lost their abillity to hear but also the noises that comes from traffic for example. All noise pollution has a limit that humans can be exposed, therefore, its up to the population ask for solutions and also fiscalization.\r\n	It is true that some people can not be concentrated when is really quite, because then any sound at all atracks their attention, however, regardless noise pollution, this poit of view should be reconsidered. A noise that affects the human productivity it that one Some capacity to concentrate such as those from buses and firefighters trucks. James Berlim relates some issues that residents of Silver Spring were complaim and was related to noise pollution at Ride on Depot. They were not satisfied with the "round-clock noise from the buses", wich according to one of the residents was above the limits allowed by the Environmental Agency. Also in Columbia, South Carolina, the police cars and firefighters trucks staying all night around the streets with their alarm working loud. Once people can not have a good night sleeping because of this issues, its directy reflect their daily productivity due to the unusual desconfortable body reactions. Also, when people are working in a noise environment, it is hard to mantain focused and it can affect their credibility in the work. These facts are real examples about how noise pollution can affect the human life. \r\n	In sum, certain tha the noise pollution is a problem, the governmet should look for this problems more intensively and creating solutions to slow down this raised problem. The population should claim for more fiscalization and real punishment for those who don''t respect the law and also garantee that noises from industries beeing controled by severe regulations.\r\n', '00:03:41', '2.0', '1.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.5', '9.5', '2.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.0', '1.5', '11.0', '3.0', '3.5', '3.5', '4.0', '3.0', '17.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.00', '1.75', '2.50', '2.00', '2.00', '10.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Through sound we are capable of establish a verbal communication that is efficient, we are capable of listen to beautiful art expressions such as music. Hearing is important. However, the environment created by humans (e.g. cities) and the way that people deal with their capabilty of listen is not appropriate to keep a health hearing. Based on that, communities, governments and industries should make efforts to reduce noise pollution, in order to avoid the effects that it can bring to workers and to the population.\r\n	Many industries have a noise pollution that exceed the safe limits of hearing. In the article "Noise Pollution", David Fisher states, "no person at any time should be exposed to noise levels in excess of 120 dB without proper hearing protection". The exposure of workers in industries sometimes exceed this value, what can represent a real risk to their health. The efficiency of these workers can be affected by this problem (Fisher "Noise Pollution"). The requirement of protections against high levels of noise should be mandatory by law. The companies are responsible for the life and the well-being of their workers, for that reason these companies should receive fines when failing in provide a safe place of work.\r\n	But the noise pollution is not present just in industries. It is present in almost everywhere in cities. From the anoying teenagers neighboors to the sound of airplanes, the sound information transmited is in high levels. James Berlin, in a article talking about the noise spawn from buses idling on depot near residences, Berlin quotes Eric Peek, "The noise [of the buses] is three times the Environment Protection Agency''s limit" ("Mont County"). And this is just one of the situtations that residents have to face while living in cities. Create actions to protect the residents is not a easy action, but for startes the government should split correctly the sections in the city. Airports, industries should not be near residential areas. The traffic of trucks should be directioned and limited to certain roads, maintaining it far away from people.\r\n	After long exposure to noise pollution, a person can experience hearing loss and other health problems (Fisher "Noise Pollution"). But beyond physical problems, the person can experience psycological problems, such as sleeping problems, mood alterarions, even deeper problems (Fisher "Noise Pollution"). Observing that, it is clear that precautions must be taken. Some precautions are responsability of government and industry, but others are responsability of each person. A big enemy of the ear is headphones, from the article written by Fisher we can infer that listen to music at loud (not necessarily using headphones) for a long a time can cause irreversible problems.\r\n	The solution to noise polution is a sum of actions coming from companies (e.g. industries, airports, others), from the government and from each person individuality. There is no more or less important on that, the important is working to provide health to all. Big part of our communication capability and of our expression is transmited through sound. We have to try to keep it safe.

In fact the noise pollution may be more dangerous than the others kind of pollution, and the reason is because many people currently are affect by this pollution, some people do not even know that this pollution is more present in their life than the others. And this kind of pollution increase when the people started to live in big cities and also the technology bring to the society many new ways to produce noise pollution, example of that is the industries that affect many people around because their noisy. Also According to the article:" vows to crack down noise pollution" is possible to see an example of the buses make noisy in that area, the people there can not sleep or life their life in peace,a resident there said: "We can hear them during the night and very early in the morning" this person is taking about the buses,which make too much noise pollution in this area. The noise pollution is a health hazard because its can cause many problems to the people, problems such as physical and also psychological health problem.\r\n	There are levels of noisy and to be considered noise pollution the sound have to be above the 90dB, 90dB is the equivalent to the sound produde by a car. Currently the noise pollution in the cities is more than it so many people are exposure to this level of sound, some people are exposure to high level of noisy, for example: 120, 130 or 150 dB and they do know anything about this. But the exposure of noise pollution, can bring several health problem to the people. The people, who lives with this kind of pollution every day can lose the ability to hear something, and is not just it the excessive exposure of the noise pollution can also  many effects the human body. The article " Noise Pollution" says that the noise pollution "effects include changes in the integral body functions, such as the electrical activity of the brain, hert and breathing rates, and muscle mobility."(Fisher,David). So according to this passage is possible to conclude that the noise pollution cause more problem than we thought. Also there are some studies that says that noise pollution may affect the our blood pressure and change the size of our glands, and after that is possible see syntoms of fatigue and sadness.\r\n	Other problem that  might be cause by the noise pollution is the psychological problem. The noisy can make the people become more irritable, and is because the noisy do not let the person feel relax. and in some cause the people know that this noisy can be stopped but in fact the can not do that. Example of this is a midnight party that someone made in a apartment the neighbors of this person may not be able to sleep because the sound is too loudy and the know that this noisy can be reduce or stopped. So this make them more tense and in the next day probably the people who could not sleep because of the noisy will be very stressful. And if this party happen again certanly  these people who could not sleep will be mad and maybe they can something dumb, like knock the guy who made the party. But the best thing to do in this case is call the police and explain the situation and certanly the police will ask the guy,who made the party, turn off the sound. Also the noise pollution influence the reduced of produtivity in a job. And is because people,who is exposure too much to a loudy sounds started toi have mental fatigue, the reason is because the sound do not  let the brain relax and made a uncomfortable situation for our brain and for the body too.\r\n	At last is possible to conclude that the noise pollution is not good for the society. The noise pollution cause to the human body and to the human mind  several problems, such as become more stressful and lost the ability to hear. Because of this reason the people should try to eliminate the noise polution or try to reduce to a level bellow the 90dB. If there is someone or some place produce noise pollution the people near by this place must have to try make contact with the person who is make noise and ask him to reduce the sound, but this does not work the people should contact the goverment and make the goverment know that the noisy is not good for the people in that place. In other words the people should care more about the noisy and if the seem that there is noise pollution they should to everything possible to eliminate the noise. Because loudy sounds is no good for the people and everybody have to have a time to relax.', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '3.0', '3.0', '1.5', '3.0', '2.0', '12.5', 0, ''),

These sounds come of workers in a building, cars and others variety of places. The problem is that they gradual affect the people''s integraty. Many effect sounds can be visualized in people who live in this type of cities such as human body disfunction, mental illness and reduction of productivity. Even though is truly that it is difficult situation to be controlled, in fact, noise pollution effects like sensority diseases, mental illness and the reduction of productivity should be prevented.\r\n	Firtly, stay a long time exposured to high levels of sound can harm sensority organs. The loud noise can create a irreversible damage in human body. If sounds were not controlled they can affect not only the ear but also another body functions like the electrical activity of the brain, heart and muscles. Humans have a limit level of volume to be exposured and according with David Fisher "Exposure to noise in excess of 90dB...for eight hours in any twenty-four hours for five days a week can lead to permanent hearing."(Fisher 1) That data show how human body is sensible to loud noise and should not be exposure to harm level of sound. Thereby, is good sense of health is needed for every part of society to prevent this exposure.\r\n	Secondly, and more deep effect, noise pollution can be responsible for psychological disturbances. People need like 8 sleep hours to take back the energy lost during the day and if that time were interrupted every day can cause some real problems. Their mentality will be affected, they become more irritable, and consequently their sociability in work or family places could be damage. People can develop aggressiveness in response of noise pollution; Mr. Fisher gives an example of irritability occurred in Britain: "a man was jailed for digging up a speed bump outside his house because the noise caused by trucks driving over it prevented him from sleeping."(Fisher 1) That is really a reaction that can develop in people affected by noise pollution, and in fact, is not so abnormal like some people think. So, more than cause physical problems, noise pollution can cause serious mental problems possibiliting effects for many people.\r\n	However, noise pollution present health problems and a lot of negative impacts in society, companies do not have policies to minimize these effects. Companies owners do not have, in majority, do not have efficienty rules to prevent damage caused by noise pollution. In consequence, people who are directly affected by high level of sounds, try to convince companies to present a limit and rules to solve that problem. In an article posted in Washignton Post website, James Berlin shows the fight of rights of some residents that leave near a place where has 150 buses making every day noise levels of sound. According with Mr. Berlin residents complained about the buses sound disturbing their sleep time and the response of the a chief of the company, Carolyn Biggins was:" Our general policy is that we don''t allow our buses to be idled for longer than three minutes," differently that was in video records, which they show "buses idling for more than a half hour with no one in sight".(Berlin 1) That demonstrate controversial ideas about the company. Thereby, these policies of prevent high sounds should be controlled massively and if some company diruspt the rules should receive a punishment.\r\n	To close this statement, noise pollution cause reduction of productivity. In reason of the irritability, people could develop non-optimistic thoughts affecting their real capacity to socializate. This loss of socialization resulting in inefficiency, feelings of isolation, and some accidents. In his article, Mr. Fisher argues about that: "That productivity and efficiency can be seriously affected by high noise levels and that fewer mistakes are typically made when noise levels are reduced. When a reduction in productivity occurs, it can be a direct result of the mental fatigue."(Fisher 1) Thereby, productivity and efficieny are type of fuel for humans to stay optmistic and if they lose them will affect directly in their mind. That is not a normal point that people argument about noise pollution but truly can be serious if it were developed for a long time because it can really cause a mental disease and worst, depression.\r\n	In conclusion, noise pollution is a problem around society and affecting people in many ways. It can affect their health, mind and even their productivity. To try to control its impact, every type of companies need to develop policies and rules to prevent damage in society. But, unfortunately, many example of rules disruption were noticed against the people health. This issue is realy an important situation to be discussed and organizations, together with the government, should implement strongs people protection rules to prevent more problems and help people who were alredy damaged. Companies may complain about these rules, justifying that some noises are impossible to control but is evident the quantities of devices which help to reduce the noise like earplugs and headsets even acustic isolate materials in the company places. They can also offer for workers consultations with doctors. So, in that way, companies can continue to developing their economy without have to affect so much the people''s life.                \r\n	', '00:02:38', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '13.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '11.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.50', '3.00', '2.50', '2.00', '2.25', '12.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

The more developed the society become increasingly high levels of noise could be noticed.  This problem could be considered a price that everybody must pay for the development since modern inventions and industries that has boosted the world economy are directly related for the excessive noise. Even though this fact induce the idea that the noise problem is a necessary hazard, the noise pollution is a serious health concern that not only cause damage on the human ears but also could be the responsible for many differents health problems.\r\n	Firstly, The exposition to high levels of noise corrupts the human listenning capability. The human ear is capable to deal with noises until a determined limit, when this border is crossed the inner ears starts to suffer damage whose level is dependent of the time and noise level exposition. According to Fischer, the continue exposure to noise that exceed 90 dB (standard measure of sound level) for long period of time can cause irreversible hearing damages (1). However, it is common people being exposed to noise superior these limits, mainly who lives in big towns where we can find industries, airports, traffic jams that are the most commmon noise sources. In this way, considering that the majority of people around the world lives in big towns, and starts to suffer the noise pollution harmful effects since childhood, probably the world is toward a society increasingly with hearing problems. So, the noise pollution problem is already a worldwide health concern.\r\n	Additionally, the noise pollution hazardous effects is not only related to hearing damage. The exposition to high levels of noise changes the entire body operation. According to Fischer, the noise pollution affects since the eletrical activity of our brain until the muscle working (1). In addition, the collateral effects of excessive noise exposition can be observed from physical symptons like: change in size of glands, and blood pressures changes to psycological problems like: anxiety, and problems to sleep (Fischer 1). More over, the noise pollution have caused relationship problems between neighbors. For example, In Mont County people who lives near from the bus depot has suffering with the execessive noise produced by the engine of buses that did not respect the safety limits of noise, and also did not follow standard rules established to reduce this hazardous effects on the neighborhood (Berlin 1). As a result, the noise pollution have been affected not only our physical health but also the life in society.\r\n	Despite the hazardous effects of the noise on the human health, there is no way to vanish it from the society. Indeed, people unfortunately need to live with the collateral effects of the noise because the engines that moves our economy are the main source of noise. For example, power houses, cars, airpots, industries, all of them despite being important not only to supply our energy necessities but also hiring people and paying their salaries, produces high noise levels, and it is impossible to live in socitey withouth these entitites. However, there is a huge difference between accept the necessitie of some noise to supply basic people needs,  and allowing companies use this excuse to dump the law and avoid to invest in strategies to reduce their noise pollution. The scenario that we have seen are companies that did not respect the law putting off human health problems caused by their noise aiming increase their incomes. For example, in the Mounty Count problem with the bus depot, even though it was comproved that the bus companie was not only disrespecting the noise limit, but also the safety standards of operation, people who lives near from the depot has claimed that the company just promise but never make any decision toward to solve this problem (Berlin 1). In this way, the human health has been threaten by personal economic interst.\r\n	In sum, despite the harmful collateral effects of the noise pollution for the human physical and mental health, the noise can not only be vanished for the society because we are dependets of its main sources. However there are many possible solutions toward to reduce the noise that should be applied. For example, keeping industries and airports far from residential areas,  obligatory usage of equipments to reduce car noise, obligating people who works in high noise level use safety equipments to avoid their hearing loss, and hard fiscalization and punishment for those who disrespect the noise limits  are solutions in long and short period that can improve our quality of life. Therefore, government, companies, and people must enroll on the effort to reduce the noise in our life because this is not only a health concern but also a survivence matter.

Since then, they were being developed to improve their functions and provide easiers and technological techiniques. Today, despite the researches efforts to make silent machines, there are many of them that still produce loud noises. Also, as a consequence of the bigger number of machines in the merchant, the noise pollution has becoming a very complex and current challenge. Very often, workers are exposed to this noises and may be suscpetiple to have problems for the rest of their lives. One of these problems is the hearing damage caused by loud and continuous noise. However, not only workers are exposed to noises harms. People in their homes may be exposed to the environmental noises, which very often contibutes to interrupt their sleep. This interruption, for example, can cause psychological damage, making people more irritated and tense in their daily lives. The exposition to a loud or continuous noise can cause ear damage in a long-term period, and can cause psychological distubances.\r\n	Firstly, loud and continous noise can damage the hearing function of a person that is very exposed to it. The humans ears have a limit to the sound levels and, if a person is exposed to some high-level sound very often, he or she may have an audition problem in a long-term period. More scpecifcaly, a bus driver who works close to the bus machine during eight hours per day, for 20 years, may be susceptible to loss of hearing. According to David Fisher, "Permanent damage occurs when exposure to excessive noise continues over a long period of time." (Fisher) Based on this, people should be careful about the environment where they work, or live, due to prevent theirselves from future problems. Therefore, to be exposed continuously to a noise, or hear loud noise often, can harm the hearing ability.\r\n	In adition, psychological disturbs can damage people because of their exposition to some noise during the sleep time. People may become more tense and irritated because of an eventual, and interrupting, noise during their sleep period. Even worst is if a continuous and irking noise private people from sleeping. These situations are very common and according to James Berlin, in Silver Spring there is a recorrent problem, "In the leafy neighborhood near depot, it''a a loud kind of a rumbling sound." (Berlin) This episody in Silver Spring is a good example where the neighborhood is being bothered for a bus company with their noisy buses. These people living there may be susceptible to psycological disturbs once they cannot solve the problem. Moreover, Berlin explains, "Some residents say for two decades they have complained about round-the-clock noise from the buses." (Berlin) This problem may be interferring in the neighborhood''s lives and damaging their sleep time. Therefore, interrupting noises during the sleep time can harm prychological disturs in people.\r\n	Briefly, people can be damaged beyond repair if they are exposed to a very loud, or a continuous, noise because humans have a sensibility limit to noise levels. Also, people who have their sleep time interrupted by noise can be psychologicaly affected, becoming more irked and tense. As noted, noise pollution can have several consequences to the overall society and can affect negatively many parameters of people''s lives. In this way, people should avoid and work agaist noise pollution to prevent themselves from the harmless that it causes. This would require some support from engeneering industry to prevent people from noise and, also, some devices for those workers who have immediat and frequent contact with loud noise. Thus, noise pollution is a very complex problem that, probably, still requires many technological development to be solved.', '00:07:38', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '14.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.0', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.75', '3.00', '2.50', '2.50', '13.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Since the moment we are dealing with responsabilities from the daily life or sleeping at night. There are a lot of situations resulting in noise pollution and it is been a polemic topic because it is a reflex from different people, behaviors, necessities and contraditory opinions. The reasons for being a concerned topic is related to the fact that loud souds have the power of being the responsible for physica effects, psychological disturbances and inefficiency from people.\r\n	Noise pollution can become the responsible for physical effects in people''s lives. In the society, people deal with noises all the time. Since the moment spent at home or at work, people are submetted to noise pollution resulted from activities of people''s routine. David Fisher, the author of "Noise Pollution" explains that the "exposure to excessive noise levels" can result in many physical effects in all the body of a person including even "function changes of the brain, heart, breathing rates, and muscle mobility"(Fisher). Fisher says also that the main physical effect considered in the live of a person is refered to the hearing loss. The life of a student of Chemical Engineering can be given with several examples of situations that the risk of hearing loss are presented. Studying at night, in Brazil, also it is required from the student a part-time working in a company that there is a higher probability of exist noise pollution. While having the possibility to live in a residential area near to construction''s areas, the student may have loudly neighboors and still have a work at a company that produces noise related to the production of candys with huge noise machines for example. The student in that example is exposured to noise pollution in many situations and if there are no ways to prevent loudly sounds, in the future, the student can deal with terrific problems related to hearing loss.\r\n	The presence of loud noise have not only physical effects but it can contribute also to psychological disturbances. In the neighborhood, there are noise sounds related to a loud music or the company near that have a schedule of 24 hours working or even a neighbor that enjoys to change the day for the night and make a lot of noise all the night. Fisher emphasizes that being exposure constantly to loud pollution can react in the "interruption of sleep" resulting in negative consequences because "people can become tense, irritable, and resentful about the cause of the noise"(Fisher). For instance, James Berlin, the author of "Mont County Vows To Crack Down on Noise Pollution At Ride On Depot" shows a situation where "buses were disturbing people not only for their presence of the depot but for the reason that the drivers of the buses didn''t follow the rules and were let the buses idling more than three-minute even during the night"(Berlin). It was the beginning of a huge problem that contributed to people''s working against the buses saying that drivers have to follow the regulations. The reaction was an consequence of psycological disturbance resulted of noise pollution from buses making people "tense, irritable and resentful.\r\n	Loud noise is also the responsible for inefficiency from people. Since the moment that people is working or studying or reading, they need to focus to get a great result from what they are doing. Fisher points out that noise sounds are being the main responsible for "feelings of isolations and accidents because they affect productivity and efficiency producing mistakes made when high noise levels are presented"(Fisher). A classic example is given when an exam is being applied. To be concentrate, people need to have a calm environment where the silence is presented. If teachers or students or there are loud noise near to the class, it can contribute to the fail of the student. A recent experience was the fact that I was being submetted to a huge exam that would change my life. I studied hard and when I was taking the exam there were people making noise affecting me and I couldn''t me focus on my test. The result of the test was not what I expected. Loud noise or even some noise disturbs people contributing to innefficient work.\r\n	Thus, noise pollution is a problem that people need to be aware because it can contribute for problems that may lead to irreversible situations. While having physical effects in people''s lives, it has as consequences, phychological disturbances and inefficiency behavior from people. It is a huge problem that people should take a time to be carefully about how to prevent all the possible consequences and act to protect themselves against that applying effective procedures.\r\n', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '14.5', '2.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.50', '3.00', '2.75', '3.00', '2.50', '13.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

They were produced many kind of plants to sale them in a local markets. These plants were growing in the nutural enviroments to produce a various kinds of vegetable and fruit. They also have animal farms for chickens and eggs producers or for meat animals. But nowadays, modern life brought a factory farming. It''s about big minifactories have a vast and large farms to produce food much faster and cheaper than the regular farms. People have different opinion about this modern farms. But in the railiety, factory farming has both benefitst and dangers.\r\n	First of all, factory farming has many advantiges in our modern life now. The common benefits these farms have are maximize the amount of food and make its cost lower than before. David Fisher mintion in " Factory Farming" that these large farming companies are using new techniques to miximize the food. The owner of this kind business has to have many huge lands to do this business. They use a large machines for a crop farm which produce corn, soybeans, and wheat (Fisher). According to him, these factories are using some chemicals to inject the animals with antibiotics to prevent diseases and they reach them some vitamin to make them grow quickly (Fisher). They also do that for plants for the same goal and additional one which is to save the plants from the insects. For examples, "factory farms are the source of 74 percent of the world''s poultry, 68 percent of eggs, 50 percent of pork, and 43 percent of beef" (Worldwatch by Fisher.) This shows how factory farming increase the amount of food. Also these factories made the green revolution, and the allowed people to eat mare meat than before with cheap prices. \r\n	However, at the same time they benefit us, the factory farming also affects the world negatively. These fod that modern farms produce are not very healthy as same as the food that grow in the regular farms. Fisher said " food advocates claim that pesticides in factory farmed fruit and vegetable and hormones in meat are not safe for human consumption" (Fisher.) This way when the produce unhealthy food is in humane. They may brought more diseases for our society. Also, with these chemicals and machines they are using in their business, they are destroying the enviroment and changing genetics of the animals and plants. Moreover, the most origenal farmers are kind of poor people. When these factories became they make those small farmers to change their jobs and they made them to find some other sources for earning money to live (Berlin.) According to him, in this way, factory farming have changed the whole cultures. \r\n	In sum, factory farming brought many advantiges for our life such as miximizing profits and make the cost cheaper. In the other hand, they made some dangers things. For inestant, the food they make is not very healthy and they may destroy the enviroment over the time.

Then they developing a new ways to cover their nutritional requirments through inplantations and domesticated the animals. But this development did not stop and growing of the farms become a competation for  the people. Covering of the food requirment were rosen to be a souce of collacting money ,so now ady the farm become a copmuny to increase the amount of the products and the quality of the food.But do we need more?And do this factory fit for all communties?\r\n        The combination between the two words factory and farming is refering to one thing which is harvest of the money. Today  this industries become one of the main soruces of the food products According to Fisher David in "Factory Farming" According to Worldwatch, factory farms are the source of 74 percent of the world''s poultry, 68 percent of egg, 50 percent of pork, and 43 percent of beef." (David) these number are giving an indecation to the size of the invesment of these industries.

In reality, two main things in the world, which are foods and drinks, are required for any people to be survived. Reducing any of them, oviously, will effict the serious peoblem. Even though some people think that factory farming increase the number of poor nations, the majority of people support the idea of factory farming for three advantages, which are factory farming reduces the price, feeds the world poulation, and rises the industrial farming.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, one of the advantages of factory farming is to reduce the price of foods. The main reason for many people, who are not able to eat specific kind of food, is lack of funds. Decreasing the price for foods helps many people to get out of this iusse, as many develop countries do resently. According to the David Fisher, "Consumers appreciate the cheap prices made possible by factory farms," ("Factory Farming."). It can be clearly seen that factory farms help to reduce the price. In other words, many customers look at the cheap price first and gradully look at the high price until he or she finds the need. Fisher also notes that by making the price cheap people can eat meat more than before. As a consequance, Factory farming is new method to reduce the prices.\r\n\r\nSecondly, increasing the population in the global world make is a big concern for many people, as some of them might not be able to eat. Using factory farming helps many people to eat because the out puts of this farming are much bigger than the normal farms. Based on Fisher, "Supporters of modern farming methods believe that industrial techniques are the only way to produce enough food to reed the global population". Having food that able to feed the population increased needs to from us to increase the production and that possible by using factory farming method. Moreover, a small method of farms might not provides the same amount like factory farming.   \r\n\r\nLastly, turning to factory farming provides good impacts for the industrilaization. Since the factory farming funded by governments or business, therefore, factory farms will be able to buy a new equipments or machines because most of factory farms operate by machine instead of laber based on Fisher ("Factory Farming") . As a result for that factories definatlly will work hardly to provide new machines or equipments for the market. \r\n\r\nHowever, some people say factory farms mehtod destroy the traditional farms because of the negative impacts such as increase the poverty level for some countries. It can be seen that at many coutries who suffering this iusse such as Africans'' countries, but this is because they are not able to manage thier farms in proper way. According to Berlin, "It can destroy traditional farming methods and threaten local animal breeds, bringing more instead of less poverty to poor nations" ("Industrial Farming "). There are some negative effects, but it is possible for this traditional farms to continue after the colloborations with other farms. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Factory farming is a new method of farms and it becomes important for all of us regardless the categories of the country. Thus, Three main aspects force us to think about factory farming in serious way, factory farming reduces the price, feeds the world poulation, and rises the industrial farming.

Needs such as vegetables, fruits and meat. In the past, farmers used basic tools in their activities, these tools often make it easier to harvest and to plant crops. However, these tools have been proved useless due to their slow and less effective ways. Therefore, farmers are now driven to use more complex machines, tools and chemicals to be rewarded with as much yield of their product as possible in order to   make a profit out of their harvest. Just a few centuries ago, farming became a business more than it was a way of life, because people became greedier and wanted to make a buck load of money to be part of the upper class of society. \r\n         Factory farming was a result of the excess need of farming products by the vast majority of the population. Large coorperations producing vegetables, fruits and meats fit under the category of factory farming businesses. According to David Fisher''s article "factory farming" " Most large crop farms, owned by agriculture business... produce just a few crops (such as corn, soybeans and wheat.). also, use industrial practices such as large machines and chemical fertilizers and pesticides." The introduction of such machines and chemicals benifited the business in a major way. As the industry devloped , the demand on it''s products increased which made it nearly impposble for these farming coorperation to operate using the same methods which made them improve their ways of farming by increasing the use of ferilizers and feeding animals vitamin-rich foods to make them grow quicker.\r\n        Since the farming business has became ever so popular , it led to the spreading of these large coorperations into third world countries in Africa, South America and South East Asia. Although the countries that welcomed these agricultural coorperations are profitting , they are missing the bigger picture. Their environments are being squandered and devastated due to the actions of these industrial farms.  James Berlin mentions in his article "Industrial farming threatens the third world" that these companies only protect the environment by following the laws of their host contries, more often than not these third world countries are very lenient when it comes to laws regarding the safety and well-being of their environment. Moreover these farms make it  impossible for locals to start their own businesses because they dump their waste on lands making it unusable. \r\n      Although these companies provide these necassities it''s hard to not think about how much the harm outweighs the benifits. Farming operations are facing criticsm from the public over their abuse of the land and "unhumane" activities. Acoording to Fisher reseachers say that achieving such a high yield of crops can be done with a smaller, more sustainable model of farming and without the destruction of the environment.

And also how can they get what they need as human from food? The ansewr for these questions is Fctory farming is the best choice and technique to let people around the world get more comfortable whith thier living, The green revolution was characterized by larger US farms and dramatic increeses in agricultural productivity that helped to feed a growing world population.(Fisher) and this means that non of the traditional methods is cabable to  function as factor farming, Also people are agreed to have this kind of farming beacuse it achievs their needs and that why the green reolution was increesed dramaticly.\r\n\r\nNext, people in all countries arev required to keep their lands, beaches and pupblic propert in safe side,therefore, fctory farming makes a good improvements that they are making in ares such as animal and the environment.(Fisher) and that could prove that factory farming is a good solution to release poverty and keep the environment more safe  and capable to produce healthier food and keeps environment renewable.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, changes are acceptable deponds on needs and time, So farming might solve many problems such as poverty and health but factory farming might solve better than poverty and health, which is the amount of food  that can be given to the whole population, also it might protect envitoments by using advanced technology.

Large corporarions that produce most foods and meats use huge areas of land to product a few kinds of foods such as wheat, corn, and soybeans. Moreover, they use huge place to produce thousands of farm animals. This kind of farming hurts directly our enviroment because thst led to s large amout of animals'' waste which is ganerally dupmed in the ground. In "Industrial Farmin Threatens the Third World," found in New York Times,  James Berlin says," large amount of waste produced by animals is dumped directly into delicate ecosystems." Thes hude amount of waste led to detroy ecosystems. Beside that farmers used to farm a variety of foods in the same place, while facory farming use only a few find of foods in the same places> THat also affect on the langd.\r\n         Beside the huge waste of animils, factory farming threats traditional farming becuace factory provides  cheaper food than lacal farming . A lot of families depend on farming in local and smal lands. They make their bussiniss by product a variety of crops and Livetock. However, these familis could lose their business because they cant not stand agains the cheaper price that is offered from thes cooperations. As aresult, these families do not farm again in the land and this led to do not use th land. As side effect , that led to affect on the ecosystems because families leave the farnm in their land. Berlin mentions," these small farmers often lose their liveihood, and are driven out of business because they simply cannot compete with the low prices," (Berlin) Farming factory that is run by a few people cause to lose alot of small farmer''s business.\r\n       However, the supprters of factory farming beleive that only in factory farming, they can provide food for people in cheap price. by entering technology in the factory farming, foods became cheap and avairable for people. Moreover, they claim they can provide food security and safety. Actully, it is ture that they provide cheap food but is if safety and health.

Still, others belive that this is a perfict way to feed and provide food to people who are grawwing rapidly around the world. In addition, this kind of farmers offer a cheape prodects costs which make not only the rich consumers can eat the meat but also the poor of them can. Thus, the most commen reasens make the factor farming the beast and ideal solution to solve the vast population grow are huge amount crops farm, invintion a new types of crops, and low coste. \r\n	To begine with, a huge amount of cropes which can prodect in the factory farming help population drastically to find food and to eat. As we now and side the population are growing rapidly espially in the first world countries as  anormal result to decrease a wars. This people need a lot of food to make them satissfy and comfortable about their life. The old system farmers consider not enough to provides vegitables, friutes, meat, egges, etc to the people. Therefor, It have been find a new alternatives to provide food which consider the nervise of life. According to David Fisher, "industrial techniques are the only way to peoduce enough food to feed the global population." (Fisher). In this artical the author discuses the benifets of factory farming coper with the negative faces. He bleive that the best way to feed people ariund the world is that use modren techniqes to prodect food.

Second, it effect on the environment because this countries less take caeer about the contamunate environment. According to James Berlin, "third world goverments are frequently less strict about environmental countrols than are first world nation." (Berlin). Beased what the author say, the tired countries don''t mantione to the environment case which is considered the more important in the world because it effected nagatively over our life.

They used these tools for building a great civilizations. Also, early humans intersted to use technology in the field of agriculture in order to increase the crop of plants such as grain, fruit, vegetable..etc. Therefore with the development that took place in agriculture field, humans being built a great civilization in the ancient world. The civilization of Mesopotamia in the middle east was one of great civilization in the world. In the last two centuruies, with industrial revolution, many technological tools werte used in agricultur. So, the crops of different plants are increased and many counteries in the wastern world became a deveped counteries.

So, increasing the production of food is important to survive people around the world.many people who support farming factory think that is a good method to provide enough food in order to keep people''s lives around the world (Fisher "Factorty Farming").Moreover, increasing agriculure productions refelct positvely no only on people but also on animals. It help to increase th number of animals in world. these animals are essential part of peaple''e food. Increasing the amount of grains is the main reason to develop large factory farming of animals that allow people to buy themeat products more times (Fisher " Factory Farming."). Also, these factory farming is a good place to use the new technical tools and use a new scientific ways that conyribute to product  best, healthy kind of crops and animals.Fore eaxmple, in the field of animals production, they use new chemachal substances that improve the type of meat of these anmials. Using new process , new food enhance with vitamin, and antibiotics that help to increase the amount of meat production ( Fisher " Factory FArming").\r\n         Secondly, factories farming contribute to improve people''s lives. These facories offer many jobs for people to work. Also, they give a good salary. so, they help people to live in a good position.

In US , using technological prosess in factories farming contribite in increasing the profites of factories and deacrese the price of food (Fisher "Factory Farming"). So, a factory farming help to improve the people''s lives.\r\n           However many people argue that factory farming develp nations. they think that these factory causes many problems to people and environment. Some people believe that these factories cause many efforts to people who have a small farming and decrease the income of these people. when the number of factories farming increase in a develping counteries, they destroy the small and simple farmers of local people and decrease their income ( Berline "Industrial Farming"). Also, other people think that these factories cause many damge to the invernoment because these companies use different kind of technology and chemecal substances in order to make profites and these technology tools have a negative effect on envitonment. Factories companies destroy and effeort many nations in the world (Berlin " Industrial Farming").\r\n        In conclusion, Factory farming is best way to increase the production of agriculture crops that contribute to improve people''s lives. Also, by establish a new and big factory farming, our world is able prevent the disaster of increasing the population in the world. With these factory people able to build a great, peaceful, wonderful civilizations in our planet. More over, with these factories our world is able to decrease the poverty that killed many people around the world.

Countries are using very sophisticated method for preducing many kinds of crops by using factory farming , this idea of factory farming helps many country to get much money and it does not cost the consumers to much.However, many critics say that factory farming is not a good idea for the countries that have a high portion of poor people because these kinds of prodections are non friendly with the environment and the chemical things that the farmers use  are very dengerous for animals and human health .(Fisher"Factory Farming").  So, developing countries should prevent or control the idea of factory farming because it threats the country economy and pollutes the environment .\r\n	Many countries that depende on producing crops by using the method of industial farming are suffering from the economy threatening . Using the new method of factory farming will kill the traditional way that many counries used to grow the corps and threatens the animal . For example , many farmers stop working in their farms because the industrial farming offers very cheap prices to the consumers so the consumers will go to get the processing food instead of geting the organic food. the farmers cannot compete with the industrial farming because the low prices not only for fruits and vegetables but also for the animals meat. when and factory farm starts working near any farm the farmers will give up because they will not be able to lose all them animals and crops.(Berlin"Industrial Farming"). So the factory farming is very dangerous for the nations economy and the goverments should control this issue.\r\n	industrial farming threats the environment and it is very dangerous for the human life . The industrial system has many chemicals substances and very big  amount of animals  waste. (Fisher"Factory Farming"). the animals that breeded in factory farm are producing vary large amount of waste that go directly into the soil and cause  very big damage to the land so the lands will not be sutitable place for the normal farming that the famers used to grow their corps and breed their animals.(Berlin"Industrial Farming").For example, in the past all the animals had different time to grow up and get ready to slaught and eat by the humans like chickin that took almost 4 months to be ready for slaught , but nowadays the chicken take just 50 days to grow up and be ready for slaughting.  \r\n	 using factory farming has side affect in human''s body and enveronment. However , if the countries cotrol this idea and try to teach the farmers to use it in a good way it will become very useful for all the farmers and the nation . the using of factory farming method in the right way by using exeptable portions of the chemical subestances that agreed from the government will help the country to grow and support the economy . Using this kind of technology in future will be the first one because it gets much money and the farmers will not lose time for waiting the corps or the animals until they grow in normal time.\r\n	In summary, the government should prevent any kind of things that harm the human or try to desitroy the economy of its nation. With using actory farming many people who work in this project will get money and brofit but they are just thinking in money and make benifit without thing in the human life and health , so the government should take the place in this case and be the strongest arm to prevent this kind of daners.

All those developments in the country helped to iniciate the growing of cities and the movement of people from the rural to the metropolitan areas. This uncontroled migration made society concerned about food source and food provisions. To overcome to this situation corporations dedicated to the massive production of food were installed in rural areas accross countries such as United States (Fisher "Factory Farming"). This corporations are bringing to citizens considerable amounts of food at a low cost (Fisher "Factory Frming"). This phenomenon is being seen in developing countries, and is a matter to concerned. Developing nations shouldn''t pursue factory farming as a way to feed their population and not even as an economy path because it contaminates the ecosystem and also increases social problems.\r\n	Factory farms are a source of contamination. With technological advancements such as: farm machines; synthetized fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides used in agriculture; and antibiotics, and hormones used in meat and dairy production; food production in factory farms is increassing (Fisher "Factory Farms"). However, at the end of the production process, all those chemicals mentioned before are discharged into the environment and contaminates water corps and fields (Berlin "Industrial Farming" and Fisher "Factory Farms"). In developing nations, environmental laws are less strict, his allows factory farm corporations to pursue their big profit plans without regards of public health consequences (Berlin "Industrial Farming"). People in rural areas are getting sick due to the use of chemicals in production fields. This chemicals are lixiviating and draining to the water corps contaminating them and poisoning food, animals and people. Furthermore, in big cities, people is consuming food with high amounts of contaminants such as hormones, antibiotics, and all those chemicals used in the farming process. \r\n	On the other hand there is a direct social problem caused by this new way of food production. In developing countries, the population of rural areas are leaving their houses and moving to big cities. This is a consequence to their uncapacity to produce livelihoods and to compete in a profitable way with this big corporations that are installing their production fields or buildings in rural areas (Berlin "Industrial Farming"). As local farmers are not longer able to produce their food, they move to the cities pursuing to find a job to provide their families with roof, food and education; but they arrived to the cities in poverty conditions and is worse when they cannot find a job. This migration phenomenon is rising the violent episodes in metropolitan areas because, sometimes rurals have to steal to make a living.\r\n	Governments should pay more attention to this globalized economy trend to protect their hydric resources, forest and fauna. The main focus shouldn''t be price-quantity food relationship as big corporations are willing us to see. Big companies only care about annual bonnus to their owners, and no to the quality of food they are providing, neither how they are producing that food. Public health problems are increassing in citizens due to cancer related food consumption sold by this unscrupulous companies; and governants should do about that. For example, local agriculture should be supported, because is in long term environmentally and socially sustainable (Fisher "Factory Farming"); strongest legislations that set boundaries to factory farms and minimize their negative impact in the world (Berlin "Industrial Farming")\r\n	In conclusion, environment and citizens should being protected by their governments in developing nations when farming corporations are willing to install their production fields.

This way to production is essential for our world, mainly for coutries in developing, otherwise would be more difficult to provide enough food in a low cost for the population as  well the government''s regulation could be more eficient whether isntead of controls a large number of small farms it would be responsible to control only a few number of huge corporations. \r\n	Some critcs of the factory farming process believe that this kind of technology is dangerous in the third world because it is  responsible to destroy small farmes and consequently this countries will became poor. (Berlin - "Industrial Farming"). But if we think wildly we can see that instead of promote the poverty in a developing nation this model of production is in fact helping to feed the population of it, according to supportes of this method of production "industrial techniques are the only way to produce enough food to feed the global population" (Fisher - "Farcoty Farming"), so whether this kind of technology that increase the amount of food in the world were prohibited, the poor countries would be the fisrts to see the consequences once that in these countries the indices of people who have nothing to eat is bigger than in rich countries. Furthermore the food would be more explesive whether it would be produced by small farms using ordinary techniques, because the process would be spent more money and the result would be less profitable, therefore the price of this food wll increase and more people would not be able to pay for it. \r\n	In addition, the use of pesticides is not the big problem whether this product is used in adequated quantities. Even the small farms have to use some products to protect their crops, to avoid pest and things like this. But not all the small farmes has avaliabe agriculture engineers or professionals who know how to control the use of this products. According to Berlin, in developing countries the government does not have a strong control about agriculture activitues so in these countries this activity use to be a source of pollution ("Industrial Farming"). So we can conclude that would be extremely difficul to the government regutate a huge number of small farme than a famous corporation and this way dimish the pollution and the risks to use chemicals products.	\r\n 	Based on this arguments I believe that developing nations should porsue factory farming, becase this model of production is responsible to feed a huge part of the wolrd population besides provide that the price of the food do not be so expensive. And also the governemnt of this countries that naturaly has less control above this activities than rich countries could regulate more strict a small numebr of huge corporation than a lot of family farms spread over the country, providing less pollution once that this big organization would be regulated by the governemnt that also will control the use of chemicals products. \r\n', '00:00:00', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '3.0', '2.0', '11.5', '2.0', '2.5', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '11.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.00', '2.50', '2.25', '2.50', '2.00', '11.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

According  to the article" Factory Farming", David Fiisher says that the technology of factory farming has a beneficial effects to produce large amounts of crops and animals with lower cost for the consumers. On the other hand, the majority of people and food advocates say that factory farming is a dangerous technology and that what states  in the article" Industrial farming Threatens the Third World", James Berlin argues that factory farming has bad effects not only on economy, but also on environment. However, even though factory farming helps to produce more food for the global population, factory farming has negative impacts on economy and human''s health.\r\n	first of all, factory farming threaten the local economy for the region which uses this technology. Factory farming helps to destroy the farming ways for people who works in farms. In poor regions, people depend on farming and agriculture  as a source for living and money. If factory farming used in these regions, many of the farmers will lose their jobs and their sourse of food. According to Berlin " ... small farmers then become consumers, and they must find some other way to earn a living... In this way factory farming can change whole societies and cultures". ( Berline). farmers will become consumers instead of producers; as well the percentage of poverty will increase. therefore, factory farming has bad effects on economy.\r\n	Moreover, factory farming has dangerous impact on human. In factory farming, animals are injected with chemical materials and vitamins to grow quickly and people who work in factory farming use chemical fertilizers to help plants to grow fast , all these material are harmful for human when they are eating these kinds of food. According to Fisher " Health advocates complain about antibiotics used in animals  produtions". Because these antibiotics are harmful for both animals and human.They are harmful for animals because they are using alot to treat animals and these antibiotics will be  ineffective.

Apparently, Factory faming provides more aboundant supply for people as they need, or in other words, some countries living rely on factory farming today. Nervertheless, as the coin has two sides, everything has positive and also negative sides. Developing and poor countries should not persue Factory farming because it can also bring negative effects such as threatens to some people and animals, also enviromental pollution and health problems. \r\n	Basically, the rise of the factory faming is a big threatening for rural families and smaller family farms. It simply impacts on traditional faming by its large productivity. To be more specific, factory farming''s large productivity has turnned those small famiies farming to consumers. On other hand, factory farming started to replace traditional farming by its intensive farming methods. It would be so weak towards on factory faming. The more importantly, to satisfy the large amount of meat supply for factory farming, animals become the victimes. People ignore their rights and put some indigenous breeds in danger. As James, Berlin said in his article " Industrial Farming Threatens the Third World", "Formerly, self-sufficient small farmers then become cosumers, and they must find some other way to earn a living so they can afford to buy meat from the factory farms. In this way, factory farming can change whole societies and cultures." It is very true that factory farms alter the society and cultures subtlely. Because of the tough competition established by factory farms, it will eat all the other small family farms and make them collapse. \r\n	Besides, environmental pollution is also a serious problem which relevant to factory farming. What factory farm to do animals is put chemical into their dead bodies such as pesticides, herbicides, and synthetic to help produce a better productivity. Eventually, those chemical elements of animal waste would infleunce air and water negatively, contanminated the environment. Moreover, it also may causes health problems. David, Fisger says in Factory Farming: " Health advocates complain about antibiotics used in animal production. They argue that these drugs are now so widespread in the environment that they are becoming inefficient as medicine. Food advocates claim that pesticides in factory farmed fruits and vegetables and hormones in meat are not safe for human consumption." People put antibiotic or chemical elements to sell a better price or maintan better reputation to appreciate costumers. However, for costumers, health is the biggest thing that they care about. Accordingly, factory farming should produce less environment pollution and make products more healthier.\r\n	Though some people would argue that industrial techniques can lead farms to a better production and offter more food supplies to nation-wide. It is true that most of the world population are fed by factory farming. However, many small family farms are doing the same job to sell their products which even have food security. Compare to factory farming, small farms has more food security and it do not contaminate environments. Factory strongerly and subtlely taking away triditional farming''s oocupation and turn them into cosumers. Evantually all the traditional farming methods would be all gone, and small famliy farming would be disappeared.\r\n	Finally, nothing can be accomplished without standards. Factory farming should have rules in order to protect environment and determind the safty of food. Factory farming should be one of people''s shopping options but not the only option. Besides, animals'' rights need to be concened to prevent the large amount of animal waste. Furthermore, as David says: " A growing number of agriculture researchers, however, conclude that agriculture must move toward a smaller, more sustainable model of farming in coming decades... Small farms could be fully capable of producing the quatities of food needed for the world''s growing population without destroying the environment or mistreating animals."

Factory farming has several benefits such as: the fast production of meat at an affordable price. An Industrial Revolution occured, and with that many inovations have appeared on the surface. Using machines for mass production rather than animals or humans, machines for harvesting crops, refrgiderating containers for long distance shipping, and the role of nitrogen and phosphorus in plant growth (Fisher, 27-28). Develping countris barely sustain themselves with their premitive farming techniques; they should not be implementing or introducing factory farming yet.\r\n\r\n	Many industrial farming corporations have approached developing nations, however they do not "have these countries'' best interest at heart." as James Berlin stated in his article: Industrial Farming Threatens the Third World. In other words, they are simply not obligated to care about collateral damage as long as the are earning tremendously from these farming factories. They would be destroying the local farming methods, and sabbotaging the land, soil, and watering system with disregard (Berlin). Berling also mentioned a devastating effect of farming factories in developing countries; by destroying their indigenous farming techniques, they might be contributing to the downfall of their economy, and forcing them to become even more poor. Businesses may shut down because of the competitive meat prices, hence affecting the society dynamics. \r\n\r\n	In developed countries, such as the US, rules and regulations for agriculture, food, and waste are stringent, effective, and immediately implemented. Also, the presence of environmentalists, and human rights activists limit or delay such inhumane acts towards animals, and the environment. However in developing countries, rules and regulations are barely applicable. No one inforces rules on farming, agriculture, and waste control. Large amounts of waste is depositted in their waterstream and empty lands; polluting the environments'' most important source for living, water. It would also be contaminated with pesticides and chemicals (Berlin). \r\n\r\n	The World Bank proposed a livestock strategy that would be effective and have great outcomes on poverty, protecting the environment, promote healthy and secure food, and animals well-being (Berlin). Also, Fisher mentions the rsults of research conducted by agriculture researchers, to use smaller, adaptable farming methods. some techniques could be implemented, hence local farming can mass produce without the negative impact factory farming brings. \r\n\r\n	In conclusion, it is advised that developing nations do not implement factory farming due to the tremendous negative affects it may cause to their society.

Being a farmer is a hard job and today, it does not bring a lot of money because it is less popular than it was. Indeed, factory farming, which produces in mass, became the main food ressource. It allows to produce biggest quantity, people can buy their products at a cheaper price and it is affordable for everyone. Some of those corporations have been implanted in poor countries and have a negative impact because they pollute and have a bad effect on the economy.\r\n\r\nProducing good meats, vegetables, fruits and other things take time. Factory farming uses a lot of chemical products to make it goes faster, to avoid illnesses and most of all to make big quantities but they don''t really care about the animals. This is all about the quantity, the profit they will make and the life condition of beasts is terrible (Fisher "Factory Farming"). Plus, all the wastes that contain some chemical products affect badly the environment because it can touche the water or the earth people use. It means that those industries do not only replace local farms but can also affect their lands (Berlin "Industrial Farming"). Those industrial farming pretend that there is so many people on earth that there is no other solution to provide food to everybody. But this is an excuse because today, with all the progresses that have been made local farms would be able to do it and in a better and a more ethical way (Fisher "Factory Farming").\r\n\r\nIn poor countries, the biggest percentage of the population''s work is usually related to agriculture. When some big farming industries come and start their buisness it is really bad for the local farmers. They loose their money because people would not buy from them anymore if they have a cheapest way to do it and it kills their jobs (Berlin "Industrial Farming"). The problem is that it takes away a lot of the population''s occupations which don''t allow them to gain money anymore. So what was an idea to allow people to buy cheaper products also make them more poor or force them to find something else to do with their life, which is not always easy in developing areas. For those reasons Berlin wrote in his article that,: "In this way, factory farming can change whole societies and cultures" (Industrial Farming).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, factory farming have been created to provide a lot of food to everybody in a fastest and cheapest way but we should be careful with what it includes. It does have negative effects on the environment, can have some on the economy, especially in poor places and also asks an ethic question about animals life''s conditions. Plus, if it has been proved that small farms would be able to provide enough food, we should let them the opportunity to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '00:23:59', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '10.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '2.5', '3.0', '12.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.25', '2.00', '2.25', '2.25', '2.50', '11.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

And also, part of people in developing contries still use tradtional farming tools or methods to produce their food. Should people keep their common ways to plant vegethables and raise anmials or add new techniques to their farming work becomes a controvesy that people cannot ignore. Although some farmers would like to agree with the new techniques to assist their farm to bring plenty of benefits, they should better not use those new techiques through "Factory Farming". Actually, both advantages and disadvantages come in the same time such as the safety or danger of their products and run or break enconmy of their farms.\r\n	First of all, people cannot make sure both safty and danger of the farming process in the "Farctory Farming". New techiques of farming carry a lot of pollution that people even cannot imagine. Those pollution may have the chances to get into plants and animals''s bodys. That will hurt people''s health when people eat them. Accroding to one article "Factory Farming" by David Fisher, it says "However, these operations faces growing criticism from environmentalists, safe food proponents, and animal rights activists. Critices say that this industrial system, especially animal production, is environmentally unsustainable." The reasons for this opinion can be divided in two parts. One is the chemical pollution of air and water, and the other one is focused on the large watse fo animals. Moreover, some advocators of health still hold the view that the food in factory farming are not safe for people because of the "antibiotics used in animal production". And this chemical things will hurt people (Fisher). Thus, this is the first reason to advise farmers to not use the new techniques (Factory Farming).\r\n	Second of all, a serious economy problem will come in people''s view. In fact, the aim that people develop the factory farming is to help people estalish a convenient life, but factory farming does not achieve this aim, especially in developing countries or some rural areas. In one article "Industrial Farming Threatens the Third World" by James Berlin, people can know that the coming of factory farming destroy some poor people''s life, especially the farming in the ruarl areas. The traditional planting and rasing ways are broken. Some of area''s people still live in the simply life. The fartory farming changed their life, and then they do not plant their food so that they want to buy food from factory farming. Finally, the question was brought. They have to find a way and even spend more money to get to the factory and buy the expensive vegetables and meats (Berlin). Because of the huge population of the world, people have never ever stopped to discover a successful way to help them improve the agriculture. And also, that is why factory farming comes into public. However, in this case, factory farming is not working well and it even has more hurt on economy. \r\n	Last but not least, unkowning things always have a large number of difficulties and risks that people have to face. It is better for poor people to keep their traditional ways to work on the farm although most of all ways are outdated now. Therefore, keeping tradtional ways on agricuture should not be abolished. New techquies should only be a tool that improves traditional farming ways. That is all.\r\n	To sum up, to be honest, the costs of factory farming is not cheap for a farmer and it even not cheap for a developing country. And next,  people cannot get a lagre number of benefits from factory farming, and it even causes hurmful things for people.

On other words, the global consumption of food is raise. Many countries developed the techniques methods to get alot of quality of food, they began to intrest  of farms. The production of farms, in the past, was depend on traditional ways to get crops and meat. Producers improve their labors by develop the industrial production to earn a lot of profits and to make the costs of these production low by using different methods (Fisher "Factory farming"). This development in the agricuture has many affects on the world, it has advantage for the introducing countries and also has disadvantage for poorer countries. Therefore, it has affect on environment and economy.\r\n	Firstly, many countries around the world use variuos methods  to improve their factory farmings in order to develop the industry and thus the economy of this country. Factory farms play a major role of human consumption where it form a high proporation mor than half of meat, eggs, and poultry in the world (Fisher "Factory farming"). The producers use the technological machines and chemical substances to make these crops grow up quickly. Even though, these chemicals are useful for plants but it has negative effect on the ground and animals. So that, these crops could be harm on human consumption (Fisher "Factory farming"). This faster development of factory farming has large benefits of most countries but in the same time it has environmental effects on other countries which do not have a large ability to control of the chemical pesticides. It could be a main threater of environment in these countries and maybe it work to destory conventional method of agriculture for these countries (Berlin "Industrial Farming"). As a result, the developing of factory farms has effect of pollution  and addition to its benefits of agriculture.\r\n	Second, this widespeard of factory farming makes the economy better than in the past. The factory farming enhances the global production and improve the guality of crops or meat by using modren methods. It usage methods rely on raise the profits by using substances fertilizing contain chemicals which are useful for plants such as nitrogen and phosphorus to make the plants grow up repidly (Fisher "Factory farming"). These industrial techniques available for developing countries and it makes them get a big gap of improving economy. On the other words, instead of using the traditional ways to get production, it  used modren aspects to develop the agricuture. This developing makes the experts predict that the agriculture will convey toward through the next years because producers tend to use the modren techniques. these chang and develop the agriculture will infulance on the community, habits, and consums of poorer countries (Berlin "Industrial Farming"). \r\n	In sum, the industrial farming needs a lot of steps which should follow it to achieve the goal of the agriculture. This development of factory farming has many benefits for societies and countries such as economy advantages and it has environment effect on crops and animals.

This increase brought many threatings with it like the famine which have happened in many of the third world countries especialy when these countries are facing some natural disaster like floded, wars, and horicans.There many examples for that in African and Asian contries. This diffcult problem requires a successful ideas to solve it, but can the factory farms be one of these ideas?\r\nAccording to David Fisher in his article" Factory Farm" there is big changes have happened to the a griculture in the first world nations due to inventions of farm machines, the modern shipping, the discovery of nitrogen and phosphorus effects in the plant growth and using the chemicals to make the pesticides; herbicides and the fertilizers. Fisher states that these factors helped to begin the "green revolution" which hepled to provides unexpensive grains for animales in the farms and that made the poor people to be able to eat cheap meat. \r\nIn the other hand there are many voices against these developments in the agriculture. Fisher states that there are three group who don''t agree with the factory farm. These group include the environmental scientist, the food scientist and the people who care about the animal rights. These groups refused the methods that the facory farm are using to product plant and meat and they want to change these methods. James Berlin in his article " Industrial Farming Threatens the Third World"  also mentions the envirnmental effects of the factory farm, he demonstrates that owner of the factory farms are don''t care about the harmful environmental effects of their farm in the third world contries. Berlin further discuses the bad effects of the factory farm on the economic of the these contries because the ordinary farms of the third world countries can not stand in the face of the factory farm.\r\nSo in the face of the increase of these factory farms, there are some movments to resize them and control them because of the harmful side effects that they caused. Berlin mentions that the World Bank that helped the owners of these factory farms began to change its policy toward them to make them improve the situations of their farms. Fisher also states that there are increasing researches incaurge that the agriculture should turn to a smaller and more suitable farming in the next years.\r\nAltough of the voices of the owners of the factory farms that their farms are very important to provide the enough food for the increasing popular size in the world, but it can be noticed that many people are moving toward the ordinary farms and many people are moving toward consumption the organic food that are producing from these farm and that reflect the failing of the factory farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '00:01:29', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '10.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.5', '1.0', '3.0', '1.0', '2.0', '8.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.75', '1.50', '2.50', '1.50', '2.00', '9.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

In this case, other developed countries start to lead poorer nations to use factory farming because it provides more food and makes price lower for consumers. While, a number of people such as Health advocates and Food advocates disagree with using factory farming because it not only provides unhealthy food for people, but also destroys local enviroments. Although using factory farming can get more profits and make costs low for human, poorer nations should pay more attention on factory farms because they cause healthy problems for consumers and have risks for local enviroments.\r\n	Among than, the most important problem is that factory farming offers a number of unhealthy food for consumers. A healthy food plays an important part in people''s life, so when factory farms provide food with problems, consumers get into troubles easily. As David Fisher saies: "Food advocates claim that pesticides in factory farmed fruits and vegetables and hormones in meat are not safe for human consumption" (Fisher). For example, in some countries, especially some developing countries, a host of businessmans want to make more money so that they use much more chemicals than the normal level. In this case, when consumers buy those goods and eat them, they are likely to make their bodies unhealthier and unhealthier. Finally, those people get illness easily because of eating too much chemcials. Thus, some factory farms cause healthy problems for people.  \r\n	In addition, factory farming causes unbelievable problem of local enviroments. There is no doubt that factory farms release a lot of unhealthy air and water which cause air and water pollution when they are working. As James Berlin saies: "[The vast majority of these corporations cause] the land to be unsuitable for traditional farming methods and [cause] the land and water souces to be contaminated" (Berlin). Based on what Berlin saies, he thinks factory farming is enviromentally unsustainable bacuse when factory farming owners start their busniesses, they do not care about protecting local enviroment. On the contrary, owners are willing to use a lot of chemicals and cut trees in order to make their farms larger and make more profits, which is dangerous to local enviroments. Consequently, factory farms are harmful to the enviroment.\r\n	However, some people believe that factory farming has its advantages such as providing cheaper food. It is important for consumers to buy cheaper meat and vagetable which allows more and more people to eat meat. As David Fisher saies: "The green revolution''s production of cheap grains, in turn, led to larger animal agriculture farms and allowed more people to eat meat and meat products than ever before. Consumers appreciate the cheap prices made possible by factory farms" (Fisher). In a lot of poor countries, a number of people do not have enough food to eat and they do not have enough energy to work. Sometimes newspaper reports that a host of people died because they were hungry. In this case, factory farming shows its value because it provides more food, in turn, making price lower enough so that people are able to purchase. As a consequent, factory farms are capable of offering more food and solve hungre problem.\r\n	To sum up, developing countries should be careful to using factory farming. It is true that factory farms are able to provide more food and make price lower for consumers, but factory farming has serious problems. Factory farms cause healthey problems to people and destroy local enviroment. In the furture, poorer nations may use factory farming instead of traditional farming methods, but the government will ask factory farming owners to protect local enviroment when they are working.

Actually, industrial farming is knid of machines that can produce food to the people easily and very cheap. Although, many people like this method of producing the food because they think it is the only method that can be benefical to feed the people. However, this techniques are one of the worst thing that cause problems to the environmet. Therefore, some people disagree with those methods of producing food because it can destroy the environment of traditional farming methods, and the food can be unsafty and not security.\r\n	First of all, it is quite significant to keep the traditional farming methods because lot of people are accostomed to this kind of producing healthy food. In addition, factory farms can cause very  the risk to the environment that may destroy the land of traditional farming methods. Even though, some people think that with factory farming we can live comfortably because of the lower cost. Besides, the traditional farming cost very high prices because it needs proffessional farmers to work in this kind of feild. However, the new method can produce very quickly so that seems to us it may produce something not quality as the traditional method that most people are still sticking with. According to "Factor Farming," Fisher, David says, "[..] industrial system, especially animal production, is environmentlly unsustainable. This is because it produces unregulated air and water pollution[..]."(Fisher 1) In other words, even with benefits of industrial system it can be very dangerous to the environment, and it should be eradicated because it cause lot of problems and even to the society as well. \r\n	Secondly, the new technigues of producing the food are quite problematic because the food can be unsafty. In addition, we can see that there are many modern machines that can produce food for people very cheaply. Therfore, this kind of food can be very attractive to the poor people. For example, rice maker is one of the new technigues that can make rice very easily. However, this kind of machines does not have the quality as the regualr mehtod of making a good rice, and also there are some statistics show that rice maker can produce some chemicals when the rice inside it, then it might cause some health peoblems to the people. Some factories are not aware of the problems that the animals have, and they need to be checked because it is impprtant to the people that food is safty and security. According to "Factor Farming," Fisher, David says, " [...] in factory farmed fruits and vegetables and hormones in meat are not safe for human consumption."(Fisher 1) In other words, industrial farmed is not realible source to have good and safety food as well as in the taditional farmed.\r\n	Nevertheless, some people think that industrial farming is the only thing that can be benefical to the poor people because of the lower cost. Moreover, there are several groups of people say that factory farming is good to reduce the poverty, and it is benficial to have eqaute food to feed the global population. According to "Industrial Farming Threatens The Third World," Berlin, James says, "The orgnization released a new livestock strategy in 2001 that promised to apply guidelines to factory farms that will reduce poverty." (Berlin 1) Actually, it is true that factory farming is good in some ways, but there are many disadantages and negative impacts that need to solve. Furthermore, it is not worthy to destroy the traditonal farming methods because lot of people prefer it that thee industrial farming. Besides, most people want a safty food that does not have any problems and this point needs to be solved in the factory farming because they use a lot of chemicals that might be not security.\r\n	As we can see, the facroty farming should be eradicated because it had many negative impacts. In addtiton, there are poor peope that does not deserve to be suffering. Even though some people say that the factory farming is the best solution to reduce the poverty. However, the result was not expected because this solution was ineffective, and it needs something bigger than to just create some new modern technology with the lower cost. Therefore, we have to keep the traditonal farming methods because it is important to produce food that are very safety and also to have good environment whether to the people or the animals. Actually, it is very significant to think very carefully about the negative and postive things before creating a new technigue. Therefore, poor countries does not deserve to be the experince of bad things.', '00:19:40', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '11.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '3.0', '2.5', '13.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.75', '2.50', '2.25', '2.50', '2.25', '12.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Because, it provides them with the products they need, and it is an easier way to get food and crops for the growing population. Additionaly, there is an issue that people argue about which is agreeing on whether developing countries should change from traditional farming to factory farming or not. I personally believe that develpoing nations should not persue factory farming, because it causes damage to the environment and it increases the nation''s poverty. \r\n	Industrial farming is currently used in other financially able nations. Because, people find that it is the easiest way to deal with the growing population, due to it being fast and effective also it is cheeper for the citizens to buy these products. ( Fisher "Factory Farming") However, they do not think of the environmental consiquences it leaves. The process of factory farming includes throwing away a massive amount of animal waste and leaving it to pollute the water we need and the nature that surrounds us with its chemicals. (Berlin "Industrial Farming".) Furthermore, The people who support the idea of  industrial farming being used in poor nations, do not care about the harm it could cause to the animals, they are not aware of the dangerous methods they use to get productions, which are harsh and cruel to animals, that seem to have no rights anymore. (Fisher "Factory Farming".) Although, these people could actually be aware of the negative outcomes, but they are too focused on the money that comes from that process which leaves them blind to everything else. (Berlin "Industrial Farming".) \r\n	Another reason for why people lean towards industrial farming, is that they believe that it helps decrease the amount of poverty in the world when they do not realize that, in reality; it actually increases it and makes it worse for the poor. When industrial farming happens, it brings out more profit to the industries and it is beneficial to the rich and financially able. While that occurs, the poor suffer from having to deal with traditional farming that they had once relied on for living, but now that it is destroyed, they cannot compete with the new intense farming method which would cause them to lose their business and become even poorer than before (Berlin "Industrial Farming".) \r\n	If people could just let the thought of money leave their minds for a while they might actually be able to feel for those who they harm by their greediness and no problems will be caused. Yes, Factory farming is really helpful to other developed countries and it decreases some of the problems we face, but it is not efficient because it helps from one side which is the side of the countries that are rich and developed, and destroys the other side which includes developing countries which face enough problems already. \r\n	To conclude, developing nations should not go through this new form of farming because if they do, they will leave behind more problems that they are not ready to solve, because they already face enough issues of environmental damage and poverty, and they must think of ways to decrease these problems, industrial farming can only make them worse.

Thesedays, large-scale production is popular for every industry not only for a manufacturing business, but also for an agricultural business. There are advantages and disadvantages for factory farming which is conducted by large corporations. For developing countries, factory farming is not an appropriate method because it can cause a negative effect to a local economy, furthermore, factory farming can be significantly harmful for the environment.\r\n	First, developing nations should consider carefully before adoping a factory farming because it might destroy or weaken their local economy. In general, agricultural corporations are superior than small farms in price competativeness. James Berlin explains that if factory farming companies start their business in local area, small-scale farm owners will confront critial crisis, and their business may go to a bankrupt ("Industrial Farming Threatens"). It might be very difficult to support local companies to recover their business when they already run out of business. For this reason, small farms in developing countries should be protected form industrial farming.\r\n	Second, it is better for developing nations to keep their local farms from large agricultural corporations because factory farming may bring detrimental destruction of the environment. Sometimes developing countries tend to focus on economic development rather than other aspects such as protecting the environment or animal rights. According to an article by James Berlin, the author describes large corporations'' behavior which results in destruction of the land ("Industrial Farming Threatens the Third World"). In addition, many chemicals causing contamination to not only the land, but also to water sources ("Indutrial Farming Treatens"). Because of this reason, factory farming is not a suitable method for developing contries. \r\n	Of course, some people agree on factory farming because it has many benefits. David Fisher expained that indutrial production in agricultural food led to less price for consumers, so people can eat more meats ("Factory Farming"). Although I grant for factory farming supporters'' opinion, I maintain that small farm business is better than industrial farming. Considering sustainability of the environment, we have to think how to yield more agricultural products while protecting the environment and animals.  \r\n	In conclusion, when we consider whether implementing factory farming or not, people should think carefully on our environment. Even though factory farming has many benefits, it is harmful for a local economy and for the environment. Therefore, for devloping countries, pursing small farming is better than facfory farming due to its environment sustainability.', '00:00:34', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '4.0', '16.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.5', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '2.50', '2.75', '3.00', '3.25', '14.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Basic of the arugement that whether people should use theis new methd to supply citizens, one side of people thinks that nations even including poor countries should developing factory farming; however, other people thinks that they should not. For my point of view, I think it doesn''t have to using this new method.\r\n	First of all, no matter doing what kind of farming, it has to having some costs. At the same time of facotry farming, the envorimental problems and economic problems are becoming revelant. As the most obverivers side of influence, enveriment can be dangerous for human and animals. For example, people and animals are facing food sources and right danger under the factory farming condition. "However, these operations face growing criticism from environmentalists, safe food proponents, and animals rights activites" (David, "Factory Farming" P4). By the factory developing, the pollution come with this. Because of the new method, although it is threaten to human and animals, but also there is some benefits of factory farming. For example,  it can save much human or animals power source. The new form can using machines to work instead of by people''s hand or animals, also which means it can provide more food resources for whole world or whole country at the same time that compare to the old group farming, imporve the speed of productivity.\r\n	Second, in my opinion, indeed, people should not developing nations factory farming because of the bad influence possibility of envoriement. While the industry achieve their extremely desire of  the productively, it also go with out of control. "Furthermore, pesticides and other chemicals are released into the enviroment , causing the land and water sources to be contaminated" (James, "Industrial Farming Theratens the Third Wrld" P3). Indeed, it is always happened when a country developing by new high-level techniques--- abandon the chemcial trash everywhere, due to citizen''s living eviroment getting worse. After thousands of year, finally we have this enoumous beatiful and peace planet, it will not worth to use giant machines to produce much "trash", afterall, once the world have been destorying, the technology can not bring the world back.\r\n	Furthermore, changing the economic system seems to become a "essensial issue". Obversily, the most traditionaly way in the begining to farming is through the small family who have a ranch, to produce by themselves, then sell to the local by themselves, in other words, it is the most convinent and cheapest way to survive as a normal farmer. However, the factory farming can be a enime for them. Imagine in a small town with a small family, the whole family only can survive by selling their cows or chicken, once the factory replaced, they must go to figure out what they can do to have money so that they can buy the cows or chicken to eat. "...and they must find some other way to earn a living so they can afford to buy meat from the factory farms." (James, "Industrial Farming Threatens the Third World." P2). Afterall, it is still not suitbale for the nations who still in the poor situition or in a small city, because they even not able to start this new method in the begining, they only can make folks getting poorer and poorer.\r\n	In the conclusion, there are many ways to manage the country''s arguculture, factory farming is not the only one desire to make every nations comfortable. Every country should do the farming method depends on thier national situition. Even do the factory farming, they still need leave the eviorment and animals on the side.

In addition there was great industrial revolution in meat prodction. those prograsive in industries made humman life better than before. Although there were many diffeculties during those revolutions, human found a solution to prevent those problem, which is factory farming. Factory farming should be recommended as one of the advantages in human life because it increase farmer profits and decrease cost of the product.\n             First and foremost, agriculture  revolution had made a big differences in farmer life. farming was needed a hug number of farmers to plant a suitable number of vegetable and fruit, beside the time. this were very complicated issue at that time. As soon as agriculture has advance,because of the invention, the work become easier,do not need many farmer, and can do it with less time. this method made the farmer gain better. Collaboration between agriculture and domesticated animal to produce a new revolution, which enable the farmer to produce more grain crops to feed the animal. People were able to eat meat more than before because of the factory farming produces a cheap grains (Fisher"Factory Farming") Using pesticides are benefit to the farmer because it will kill most of insect and the product will be more healther. According to Berlin" In many less developed regions, people still rely on small-scale, subsistence farming to make a living" (Industrial Farming) This what had mentioned above, those countries are suffering from many problems because the did not use the machines in their work. If they did it, their work and live would be better. For example in Iraq, after the industrial revolution farmer were suffering from many problen, the government provide them with machines enable them to gain a lot of benefits in few period. This is conseder one of the method to encourage farmer to work more and more. \n            In the past,many people are unable to have agood income even they work over- time, but now many people are able to eat meat, vegetable,grain crops, and fruit, because the cost of those things are less than before. Moreover people can eat many kinds of fruit and vegetable from many places around the world. Exportation and inportations one of the charchterestic evidance to improve the wealthy of people. If the consumer is unable to buy those inported crops, there will be no need to inport them,as well as if there is no over left of the crops, there will be no export. providing enough food to the whole population  are aid by modren farming techniques (Fisher "Factory Farming") The number of population are increased over and over and need a hug amount of food to be able to survive, to tell the tale, hunger is the real threaten to human being and the solution is industrial farming. For instance, when Iraq suffered from punshment arter the Gulf war, people only were thinking about peoviding food to their children. People stop thinking about anything alse, like education or clothing or anymaterial because they were unable to provide the food to their children. thinking of hunger and death is the major threatens arounf the global.  \n          In sum, using invention is the only way to prevent hunger around the global. If the farmer has agood benefit from his work, it will encourage him to work more and more. Futhermore, people income is very low which make them suffer from hunger if they wold not get suitable prise for their food. Advantages of the factory farming is over weight its disadvantages and makes it win the race.

There is a type of farming called factory farming and some farms use that type of farming, which are the farms that use some chemicals and antibiotics for their animals (Fisher "Factory Farming"), fruits and vegetables to make them grow faster and be bigger. Factory farms became more popular than the regular ones in the begining of the 2000s (Fisher "Factory Farming"). People do not realise how popular factory farms are, and how most of our food is actually from these farms. According to Fisher in "Factory Farming", "Factory farms are the source of 74 percent of the world''s poultry." Factory farming is a good thing only for some people, which are the people that own a factory farm, because they make a lot of money from it. Being a consumer of these farms would not be a good thing at all, because that means we are supporting this kind of farming while we should be against it. Factory farming is unhealthy and it could be harmful, it removes small farms and it make them lose their businesses.\r\n\r\n	First of all, Factory farms are unhealthy and they are not natural at all, because they have a lot of things that are added in the things that they produce. People should be more educated about factory farming and they should know that the food that comes from these farms is not in its natural look. According to Fisher in "Factory Farming", "These producers inject the animals with antibiotics to prevent disease; they feed them vitamin-rich foods and supplements to make them grow or produce quickly." Farmers should be more truthful and they should make the things that they produce healthy and they should not change them or inject them with anything, because thay may make their animals and plant look good while they are actually unhealthy. The things that are used to make animals bigger and cleaner in factory farming, also can cause a pollution (Fisher "Factory Farming"). That is why people need to be against these farms and avoid taking food that was produced in one of them.\r\n\r\n	In Addition, most of the meat and the plants that people used to get from stores were produced in small farms that some families owned, in the past, but these days factory farming became more popular than the small farms and it took the small farms'' place in many areas. When a factory farm opens in an area, the families that have small farms loses their businesses because factory farms are cheaper (Berlin "Industrial Farming"), so it is not just that factory farms are not healthy to the consumers and the people that get the food from them, it is also bad for the people that own small farms. Having many healthy small farms in an area is better than having one unhealthy factory farm. We should support small farms to get healthier food from them.\r\n\r\n	To sum up, factory farms are not healthy like small farms and the things that they produce may be harmful for us. Factory farms could take small farms'' place when they open in an any area because they are cheaper, and that is not a good thing. Even though small farms are more expensive than factory farms, we should support them because there is no price for our health.\r\n\r\n											Work Cited\r\n\r\nFisher, David. "Facoty Farming."

Some of these countries require a high score in those tests in order for some one to get a job. China was the first country to start this type of testing and it was required there for people who wanted to work or serve with and for the goverment to get a good score in that test (Fisher, "Standardized Testing"). Some people find that system unfair or unnecessary because they think the student knowledge and education are more than just a score in a test, According to Berlin, In "How Do You Define Achievement?", "Achievement is more than test scores but also include class participation, students'' course-taking patterns, and teachers'' professional development patterns." For me, it is tottaly fair and important for every country to make this type of test required. Having standardized testing system in a country is helpful because it will make changes not only for the country but also for its schools, a change in a better way of course.\r\n\r\n	First of all, requiring standardized tests in a country can help the country itself. When the goverment see the students'' scores, they will notice a lot of things, like how low some of the scores that students in some areas have, or maybe how low the scores are in the country overall. Noticing these things can help in devoleping education and in making some good changes to the country. Also when countries do these types of tests, they can compare their students'' scores so that the country with the low scores improve and change to get higher scores. According to Fisher in "Standardized Testing", Quoting from an interview that US education Secretary Arne Duncan did, "This is an absolute wake-up call for America."\r\n\r\n	In addition, having standarized tests will help the schools in the country. Some teachers are not as good as other teachers, so it would not be fair when people think that they may even be better than others, just because of how high the students'' scores in the subject they teach, while in reality, students are cheating and the teacher is not paying attention to them because s\\he did not teach the students as s\\he should. Having the standardized test required and taken by students in every school would help the goverment see the real level for the students and it will show how bad some schools actually are because of the low scores that their students will get. According to Fisher, in "Standardized Testing", " If a school fails to show adequate yearly progress for four years in a row, it is labeled as needing corrective action and can face the wholesale replacement of its staff." That system would be great if every country did it, because it will really help every school when the goverment notice the scores and make some changes to improve it. The teachers in every school would work hard in teaching their students when the goverment require the standardized test, because they know that the goverment would notice any low scores and that could make them get in trouble or lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n	To sum up, standardized tests are really helpful in many different ways and every country should make them required. They help in making the country''s education better by improving and developing it. The tests also help the schools by making some changes when the goverment need to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n											Word Cited\r\n\r\nFisher, Charlie. "Standardized Tests." Health Studies Reader.

According to Charlie Fisher , In China an especial test called Gaokao has benn created as an esstimation method for students who want to attend  the graduate studies.However, schools shoud not classified by the scores of these tests because it could not represnt the teachers'' and students'' achievment indivedually and it could lead to clossed some schoole which is ipmortent for communties.\r\n  	The scors for the standarisation test cuold not idintified the improvments of the teacher''s abilities and student''s achievments individually. According to Thomas Berlin, the improvment and the development of education have more  detailes than the tests scor like student activites during the class, who teachers  are able to improve thier students, and silibass. The results of the standarization tests could be conflict the aim of these tests; because these tests have been created to improve the students education and the result could not represent the student achivment individually. Also students might be get high score  in these tests  depending on privet teachers or help of thier parents  and not the teachers of thier school. \r\n	 Furthermore, many schoole may be closed depending on the results of these tests. According to Berlin, school cuold be closed  or change the teachers of some schools depending on the results of achievment test. what if all the students can get high score in these test and attend the schools which are considered fit to their scores for example medical schoole, engeenering school etc. many schools might be closed because no one may want to attend low score school. This could lead to neglict other educational branches like atrs, sports, and philosophy.\r\n        In counclusion, divided the schools depending on an especial teast could not represnt the achievment of the education in the spesific country.

(396, '2015-03-09', 600016243, 2015, 1, 'a', 'Since a long time ago, a lot countries have developed different standard tests to measure and evaluate students achievements, with the objective of classify and divide them based in the results that they obtain. This practice started in China, a country that is known for its students high rated performance in some international standard tests. A good question that could be asked to China''s government and some other countries is if they really believe that those kind of tests measure the intelligence and knowlege that their people need to enter a school or university, or to get a scholarship. There are some many reasons that support the thesis that schools should not be classified by standardized test scores and they are going to be explained in this essay. \r\n\r\nIn the article called "Standardized Tests", which author is Charlie Fisher, there are some examples of tests that the students do in countries like China and United States. One of those tests is the Scholastic Aptitude Test, which is a multiple-choice test that was created in order to make the process faster. But there is a point that a lot of governments are probably leaving behind when they introduce those tests, and it is that they are probably influenced by some facts that can make the students to perform in a way that is not the accurate. It means that they would perform better or worse changing some enviromental characteristics or controlling their feelings at the time that they do the test, considering that they have a determined time to finish it, a determined probability of making the right or the wrong choice and a determined future result. For example, when i did the standard test that all the students do in my country, which includes Math, History and Language (Spanish in this particular case), i was feeling nervous, the place was not comfortable, there were a lot of students right next to me doing the same test, answering the same questions and competing at the same time for a place in the university where i wanted to study, which just have enough space for the smartest people of the country. All those facts probably influenced my result in the test, which was worse that the one that my family, friends, teachers and school expected. But the question is: How can the students prove that they have the skills or that they are smart enough to study the major that they want in the place that they want? Maybe there are not many options to change the way that the schools are measuring the students, and that is a duty that the people who are working in education areas should care about, developing other standard tests that may give the students the possibility to show that they have the skills and the capacities that they are expected to have. \r\n\r\nAn issue that would be interesting to discuss is the possibility of measure the students by their performance in the university, without giving a test of school contents. If a student graduates from primary school and highschool could mean that he/she learned the contents that are supossed to be taught to every individual that goes to school, and it also could mean that he/she is ready to enter the university and start a new process of learning, difficult but not impossible to achieve. A real problem is that the countries don''t have enough space for all the students that want to enter the university or a particular school, so they are forced to create this kind of ways to make the differences that allow them to classify the people. After knowing that information it is hard to think about the education progress of an entire country, so we should think about the education progress of each individual, refering to personal student achievements that every student has to develop in order to achieve his/her own goals. \r\n\r\nConsidering all the process that students experience in their school days, which includes teachers and other people who work there, students, and the environment, we should expect that the final test can reflect an important part of it, which is not exactly the contents of each subject. A student learns how to interact with his/her environment, how to react in some situations of life, how to communicate with other people, plus all the knowledge, but some of those things are not being measured and they totally affect the student''s future performance at the university and finally when he/she has to work. Thomas Berlin cites a definition of achievement in his article,  "Achievement- all the outcomes that students and teachers attain. Achievement is more than test scores but also includes class participation, students'' course-taking patterns, and teachers'' professional development patters." After that definition we should think about the student achievements that the countries really measuring in their tests, that are clearly related to a small part of the process, leaving important features of individuals behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '00:00:18', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '12.5', '3.0', '1.0', '1.5', '1.5', '3.0', '10.0', '3.0', '1.5', '1.5', '2.5', '3.0', '11.5', '3.00', '2.00', '2.25', '2.25', '2.50', '12.00', '3.0', '1.5', '1.5', '1.8', '2.8', '10.6', 0, '');

In around the world, schools and universities do not depend on the achievements of the classes to assess the students abilities of the class. Thomas Berlin defines achievement in his article as its inclusion of "Class Participation, students'' course-taking patterns, and teachers'' professional development patterns." However, you could find this way in some schools that are not propably standard or they are biult for the children who are still in the first grades. According to that, In my opinion, schools should be classified (measured, judged) by standardized test scores because they means the reliability and assessment for students. \r\n	First of all, Standardized tests are the only way that people and parents are going to be confident about the schools and educational instotutions that have their child or their son. When everything is not allowed for students while they are inside the class of test, this means that everything is reliable. Personally, when my teacher ask me to complete something outside the class, I will not do that assignment by myself if I know that the teacher is going to evaluate that assignment. One reason I am doing this is because I am afraid of my grades so I have no time to waste any point for tiny mistakes. Logically, no one will accept doing any tests with limitations if he/she needs some grades in order to pass that class. As a reason, standardized tests are done with limitation of time and limitation of some possible sources and teachers are in front of the students. This means that standardized tests are more reliable than the achievement way.\r\n	Moreover, standardized tests assess students'' ability. After finishing from the term or the semester of the calss, students are required to take the test in order to assess if the tehy are able enough for the next stage of the study. Fisher in his article "Standardized test," points out that these tests are made to evaluate studentys'' attitude of the calss. In another way, standardized tests are done by the companies and jobs because they assess applied employees (fisher). In addition, most of the standardized tests are known also in most industries because they try to evaluate the industrial things by standardized tests in order to know if they are ready for the market or not. Last, Standardized tests are the only way used to evaluate students'' ability. \r\n	In conclusion, Standardized tests are the should be used in schools becasue they are assessing students ability and they help parents and families know that their son passed the satge of the education successfully. Standardized tests are common between most countries of the world. Standardized test are evaluating students'' attittude; they are more reliable than using the achievenemts.

We know tset  is for understanding  how much we leran or how much I understand the text. Also recently the world wide tests, such as TOEFL or TOEIC, are getting more popular in the country where people don not use English as a mother lunguage. But people also know that tests are the only one of the ways that that they can know about themselves. I do not think it is good idea that the schools are classified by standalized test score because schools are not for the test and if schools forcus on the only test score, it can put students stereotype idea of ahievement.\r\n	Firstly, school is not the place where students will be crazy about the test score. If the school is only for the test, it will be very easy to get the highv score on the standarlized test, because they only learn how to answer these types of questions and how to think about the similar types of questions. students will get used to due to doing the same things and same thinking. But, on the other hand, it takes risks which are students cannot think in variety types of the topic in the school instead of learnig how to get the high score. Chinese school which is doing standalized test gets the high score on the test but it is because school sees the test very important (Fisher). American schools get ower score than the chinese one though, it is because American one puts a weigh on learning much more broad topics not only for the simple test for standalized (Fisher). Under this globalized situation in the world, schools cannot think about only tests. It is more improtant to think about varity topic in the school to get new knowledge for the future and for understanding what is going on in the global world. Test score cannot show us these knowlwdge. \r\n	Secondly, if the schools really focus on the test score, it is going to do brain wash for students about the achievement in the school. Mainly if people get the high score, they are regarded as amart. But this "smart" is not related to achievement. Achievement in the school can be definded as all of the things that students and teachers get (Berlin). So even if some students cannot get the high score on the test, they might get another achievement ,such as in the sports club or frindship. But these things will not show up on the test scores. People cannot know the evertthing students and teachers get on the standalized tests (Berlin). Thus, if the test score is taken as only the achievement in the school life, students who cannot get the high score even though they found very important one in their school will be defined as loser. These kind of kids might think about themselves they are not worthy in the school. \r\n	In the conclusion, we should not judged schools by standardized test because it will not show us what is the real achievemnt in this school and the school is not only for the tests but also for larning different kinds of topics even if it is not related to the test. The schools should be judged how much students are sutisfied form the knowledge and experiences they learn in their school. School has to be the place where gives the many opportunities to shine for every students. it is not always in the test score at all. \r\n\r\n											Work cited \r\nFisher, Charlie, "Standardized Tests.", Health Studies Reader, Ed.

Standardized test is allowed to evaluate depended on students abilities and educational level.  In China, their education system and standard tend to be higher than any other countries. In 2010, Chinese students took the test that is called the Gaokao, which is the Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Eaminations (Fisher). This test is used as the typical standardized test. If student education standard tend to be higher, the possibility that the company pick up smarter person is increased. However, due to the fact that to focus on standardized test scores causes that student''s ability is only high education, and students loses and are ignored their achievement.\r\n	In the beginning, if students studies for high test, their ability is only high education. This case would not be bad because when they have high education, they can get nice jobs for the future. But as a result that to take high standard test, student'' ability tend to be one ability that is just smart student. For example, Charlie Fisher states, in 2010, students who were worldwide took the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). China was the first time to take part in this test. And surprisingly, China brought only one student instead of many students. Usually, every countries bring more than two students as representator of each country to compete the education level. Chinese education is higher than any other countries.But because of this, the country like China focus on only high test. They miss some important thing to grow up.\r\n	Second, if the school focus on standardized test scores, students loses their oppotunities and achievements. Thomas Berlin quotes Richard Rothstein''s word, "Measurement of student achievement is complex." Achievement has much more valuable than the standardized test scores because although the sandardized test scores can be measured only student''s ability, Achievement test is required not only to get high test result but also emphasis class attitude, student''s course sequenses, and educator''s professional development patterns (Berlin). In comparison between the standardized test and achievement test, both of them are totally deffenrent to focus on students'' ability. And the achievement test can get more academic and general knowledge than the standardized test. That is why to focus on taking high standardized test scores has possibility to lose students'' instinct skills.\r\n	In conclusion, to focus on standardized test scores among students and schools causes decreasing current students'' education ability and losing their achievement. The high education is very good for student and school to develop each other. However, due to the fact that students does just one thing and schools forces students to focus on one thing, students'' ability and attitude toward attainnig their achievement decrease gradually. So schools should not be classified by standardized test scores. They have to be measured by students'' achievement.', '00:14:08', '2.0', '1.0', '1.5', '1.5', '1.5', '7.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.5', '2.0', '1.0', '2.5', '2.0', '9.0', '1.5', '1.5', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '9.5', '1.50', '1.75', '1.50', '2.50', '2.00', '9.25', '2.0', '1.8', '2.0', '2.0', '1.5', '9.3', 0, ''),

There are many tests that we take it in our life, such as in school, in jobs, and in our life skills. Failing on test that do not mean we already lost everything, but we have to be optimistic and start again and try to aviod our mistakes. However, there are many tests we already taken in school and might affect our career. But there are always a hope and we will try again until we success in our life. Moreover, when we fond our mistakes  early is better than we fond it later, because it might change our life from sadness to happiness. we thinks that a standerd test are great because of three main resons: to see students intelligencey, choose the optimal students, and it is fear for all studets.\r\n	firstly, their are many student are smart, but no one knows about those students. This kind of students they try to do their best, but no one give them any attention. In the article "Standardized Testing" written by Fisher, Charlie says that " French psychologist Alfred binet developed the first intelligence test, which was used by the military during the World War one to assign soldiers to jobs." This means that they choose the best soldries who have a great knowledge and they are helpful for the military. It is hrad that we choose from the public, because we have to know that they will fight for their country. For example, my friend Mohammed he have bad score on the test for the school, but he did a standard test for computers soft-wears and he got a high mark, and no one knows that he is marvelous at computers. This tells us that there are intelligent students, but we do not know about them. There are intellingent students that we do not know about them, and we do not know they have a talent.\r\n	secondly, standard tests it is great because we will choose the right and the optimal student for the specific major. This kind of tests shows how us the education going to improve or not. Predent George W. Bush made a law and that shows the students in the public schools have to take a standard test to see the student progressr on the tests scores (Fisher). Which that mean they want to know in what level the students are in, they want to know if the schools need to improve their methods or not. This test are challenging for most of the students, because it is hard and needs to study more and do well in this tests. Fisher, Charlie says that "The results are extraordinarily challenging to us and we have to deal with the burtal truth. We have to get much more serious about investing education." This tells us that it is challenging for the students and for the teachers also, because they need to teach the students the best methods to pass this tests. In the article "How Do You DEFINE ACHIEVMENT" written by Berlin, Thomas says that "Because of NCLB-and current president places Similar weight on the test score-we now use "achievement test" scores to decide whether students are entitled to tutoring services or whether they can transfer to a different school or whether we close a school and replace its staff." This shows us that the students are in the right way, because if he did not do well in the test can get moved to another school or they can take a tutoring class to help them in the test.  Standard tests it is the optimal way to see the students improvment. \r\n	Finally, the standard test are one way to see the students improvment in the edcation, also it is fear for all students because they take the same test. On top of that, they see how the students thinks and what they do in a hard test. Fisher, Charlie says that "Kids in many American schools are exposed to a wider, sometimes poen-ended, learning experience and are encouraged to expolore beyond the conventional." This tell us that the students thinking is more wide and open minded to know many things, and it is fear for every one because they will take the same test. For instance, when i was in the high school we have to take a buisness class because my major is business, so i can get general information about business and that might help me in the future, and we have taken a final test the same for every school in Oman. This kind of test makes us to see if we are improving and how well we do in the test.\r\n	All in all, the  standard tests are the great way to see how the students do in their stest. Moreover, it is one of the best way to see the intelligent students, and choose the right student for the specific major. also those kind of tests are fear for all the students. We have to know that this test are great, so we can know what major is usefull for us.', '00:19:48', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.5', '1.5', '10.0', '2.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.5', '12.0', '2.00', '2.50', '2.00', '2.50', '2.00', '11.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

There are many many ways to see the progression of students such as participation inthe class   and doing their homeworks. Howover , many people think that teachers  should be measured their students by standardized test sores . Stndrdized test scores will be helpful because  it evalutes  the students ,and it makes fell a sense of accomplishments .\r\nFirstly , standrdized test sore can be a way of evalution of the students  in their education .When students study hard for the test , they will get a good score . In fact . It is A way to see how students understand the subjects and the materials of the courses . Charlie Fisher in his article "Standardized Testing " explains that  , in chaina many people do  exam  to  know  their information in order to choose them to introduce their services for the government . He mentions that students    attain the acceptance letter for higher educatin after they enter  a treasure test  which is very  useful to get admition (Fisher) . In my knowlege , stadrdized test score is very useful to know the abilities of students in their skills . Moreover , it is an evident to know that students do a good job or bad job . In my expeierance , When the kids get  agood score , the teacher  give gifts to encourge them . Furethere more , these tests  measure the development of their students.  Furthermore , they can be a tool to konw if the students want more help or  no in the class . Fisher demonstrate that , united states  establish a new law by the president , Bush  that test students to see how they do or if they want to help to increase their knowlege  by going to another shool or supply with another teacher .In my obsevation , these grades  can put the students in  different levels  which can know the progression of them . Also , these grades encourge students to be the best and make feel very happy when getting an excellent degree.\r\nSecondly , standardized test scores make feel a sense of accomplishments . When the students work  hard and recieve a good degree , they acheive their purposes . Moreover , they tend to  contribute something in a society .  standardized score test is  a good idea to show if the students want   help in their education  . For instance if the students fail   and get a bad degree , they can change  the school or they can give them additional  lessons . Thomas Berlin in his article "How Do You Fefine Achievments " insists that universites  put many direction and instruction  to get higher degree  in graduate schoole by determining the score e of a standrdized test which is considerd one of the most important thing to admit student inthe degree. Berlin explains that accomplishment in not only getting the higher score but also doing the assingments , taking the lessons ,and the ability of teachers twho convey the information . In my obsevation ,  stadrdized test score  is a way to measure the ability of student to know the lessons and how can be self confidents . In addition , these score will increase our motivation to do  the best thing .In my country ,  the government is given a sholarship to the best students who have a high score in  every lessons that they taught . The score can lead to progress of their students  and accomplish  .\r\nIn conclusion , It is a good idea to measure the ability of students by doing the standrdized score test . Without no doubt , It is encourge the students to  study  and assess them how can do in the test . the test  indicate what the student introduce which means what the accoplishment  acheive   and progression in their work .Thus , it is advisible to study hard to gain a high score  to find himself / herself in an excellent prestigious university and acheive what he /she desire to want .\r\n\r\n\r\n', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '3.0', '1.5', '12.5', '2.5', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.0', '13.0', '2.75', '3.00', '2.25', '3.00', '1.75', '12.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

The way to grade academic achievement of student is a big issue in educational science. Standardized testing is common and efficient way because each student who takes the test is graded by how many points s/he gets, and it is useful to compare with other students and analyze the average score, highest and lowest. On the other hand, Richard Rothstein states that it is too complex to judge student achievement with standardized test (Berlin, Par.1). The U.S. government should classify schools with not only standardized testing but also other methods because various measurings show the authentic achievement of student.\r\n	Firstly, U.S. government should not quit standardized testing. The standardized testing informs how much the student understand subjects which s/he takes. At the same time, it shows what the student doesn''t master, so the student can learn this region again. In addition, the test asking many students what they learn works as statistic. This analysis provided by statistic should be comapred with other school, other states and other countries. Comparing the score with other results indicates what the school had better improve next. In fact, when I was teacher at the cram school, my boss compared the score of my students with the average points to pass the entrance examination and ordered me to reteach division in math. My students hadn''t understood it more than they need to pass the examination. This experience shows that standardized testing is effective way to compare with others to improve what teacher should do next.\r\n	Secondly, the government of the United States should introduce other grade system. The No Child Left Behind Act, legislated by the President George W. Bush in 2002, requires schools to release the test scores, and if a school get bad score and doesn''t elevate it, it will be labeled as needed corrective school. However, in the article "How Do You Define Achievement?," Thomas Berlin mentions that this "strict test-driven" causes problems because teachers need to focus on teaching for this test, and can not decide next plan; they have to follow the result of the test. Only classifying by standardized testing like the No Child Left Behind Act wants doest work effectivily. Charlie Fisher introduces the opinion of Kam Wing Chan, a geography professor in the University of Washington, that "... US education is generally far broader than simply getting good test scores, ... ("Standardied Testing," Par. 8)." This remark supports that the U.S. government should evaluate schools with not only test grade.\r\n	For these reasons, the U.S. government should classfy schools with test and other methods. Basically, standardized testing is useful tools to grade schools because it is easy to compare a school with other schools. However, the analysis provided by statistic should use for improving what teachers and schools do next. Labeling needed corrective schools is not effective way to improve the school. Addition to this point, introducing other grade system should work because schools in the United States has provided education broadly unlike for test score. Using both grade system, standardized testing and other methods will improve U.S. education.', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.5', '2.5', '13.5', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '14.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '3.00', '2.75', '2.75', '2.50', '14.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

The second one is the elemenetion of the students choice.\r\n	The consept of using this kind of test, is usually to make sure wether the student able to aply for the university or not . But is it fair that we ignore all the years that they have been studying and realy on a sheet of paeper, to go give them the green light to be acceptble.

At the same time, rankings of school are being made in base of which score students achieve in this tests. These tests usually just judge if students have the ability of memorizing or if they have logical abilities for math. These type of test scores cannot fairly measure what students have being learning during a year of class or during all high school, and neither if the school is using the right methods for teaching. \r\n     Eventhoug, ranking and classifing schools is needed, because we have the necesity of separating good schools from bad schools to make progress; but if we want  this clasification to be trustworthy, to reflect what the kids are learning and if the teaching methods are being useful, the way this students are tested should be more than just writing test scores. This rankings should be able to represent teachers abilities, infraestructure, reasearch ability, achievement and progress in the learning of students and more. All of this threw a combination of tests for students, teachers and stablishments.\r\n     Certainly, this classifications are based on the scores that students achieve in this scored tests. But the problem is that this tests not always reflect what students are learning. That is why they should be tested in a way that all of their abilities and learnings can be measured. Not only in math and history, but also in arts, musics, sports, ability to progress, participation, and more; because this topics also shows learnings in them.  \r\n      For example, many times this standardized test are created with the propose of measuring knowledgment but they end up just creating gaps between students by clasifying them. In "Standardized Testing" Fisher mentions that "Prior to this time, standardized testing has been used to clasiffy students" and we can certainly see this in the Univerity selection process; there is not enough place in the University to accept all of the high school students, so this tests selects just the "best of them", leaving the rest without opportunities. But it is known that many schools spend the whole year preparing this tests, teaching students how to give the correct answer, and behind this there is no real learning. When they manage to get into University, they are not able no get threw it because of the lacking of important abilities. \r\n     For many years, experts have being trying to find a method of testing that is apropiate. But we all know that this is a difficult and long process because, as Berlin quotes in "How Do You Define Achievement, "Measurement of students achievement is complex-too complex for the social science methods presently available". Also, as he says "we''ve asked test scores to carry ever more weight and we''ve depended on them to make ever more consequential decisions," something dangerous if we are talking about our future generations education.\r\n     Maybe the next step is starting to think what is exactly what we want to measure. If we want to continue measuring abilities of memorizing and abilities for logical thinking in math, score test are a good option. But if we want to go beyond this, if we want these rankings of schools to really reflect what students are learning, we should be creating a more extense and inclusive way of measuring knowledgment, one that does not leave outside other types of abilities. \r\n      \r\n      ', '00:41:38', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.5', '12.5', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '1.5', '10.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.25', '2.25', '2.25', '2.75', '2.00', '11.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

These kind of tests are testing the knowledge of students in many patterns. They are testing student skills. They are testing them in history, math, spelling, and geography (Fisher). However, the results of these tests were suprised because students found these tests were very hard for them. They found these tests were challenging them. Therefore, schools should not be classified by stanardized test scores and choose another test to test students because it does not test their skills, and it does not evaluate students.\r\n	First of all, schools should not be classified by stanardized test scores because stanardized test does not test student skills. To see whether students are ready to go to schools or not, schools should choose tests that are testing what students have learned.  For example, a student who is bad in math will have a problem to pass this test. In addition, standardized testing may cause a problem for students who did not study history because this test has a short section in history (Fisher). In the U.S., schools faced the problem of standardized testing are looking for a test that is better than they have ( Fisher).\r\n	Next, schools should not be classified by stanardized test scores because stanardized test does not evaluate students. To have a test that show what students have learned is very important (Berlin). Stanardized test should just test what students have learned about.

If you are students who are good at study, it doesn''t matter because they can get high score for their grade even the tests are hard. However, students who are not good at study, they might get trouble because they can''t get good score. Then if schools going to classify students by those standardized test score, they going to fail. However, achivement test are really help to students to know how they can handle the problems. The scores going to show them how much ability do they have. Therefore, standardized test scores help to know students'' ability that fail or move to next level, but it is not only way to have achievement. \r\n	Students can know their ability that fail or move to next level. "The College Entrance Examination Board, now known as the College Board, was founded in the United States in 1990. It was initially an essay-based exam testing students in math, science, literature, and Latin. In 1926, in the interests of speed of testing and evaluation, the multiple-choice Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was introduced"(Fisher 13-15). High school students in the United States should take SAT to enter the university. If students have high score for their SAT, they can apply high quality of university. If students do not have high score for their SAT, they can still apply university, but normal university. "With the concern that US schools were trailing their Soviet counterparts, standardized testing began to be used to classify schools"(Fisher 18-19). Not only United States distinguish schools by test scores, many countries do exactly same thing. In my country, South Korea, we do have entering exam for university and it is only once a year. Also, only over 19 years people can take it. Therefore, high school students are studying 3 years for only one exam and if they fail on the exam, they have to wait for another one year. There are many reasons that students are taking the entering exam for university. By test score, they could be distinguished that do they can follow the university course and do they study hard during the their high school years or do they need more study instead of going further more. I am attending EPI which is English Program for International. Every end of term, they do have test students to level up or stay same level. If students are pass their test, they can move up to next level, but people who don''t they have to stay same level. I took tests and my scores were always not enough to go next level; however, I always do my best during the classes, so my teachers were allowed me to move up to next level. Therefore, I went to Next level, so my classes level become highest level and the my classes course was very different from last term classes. My classes are really difficult and very hard to follow classes because my ability was not enough to folllow these courses,so I think that I need more study to follow the classes. Therefore, Students should classified by stardardized test score to know they ability.\r\n	Standardized test scores are not only way to have achievement. "[W]e now use "achievement test" scores to decide whether students are entitled to tutoring services or whether they can transfer to a different school of whether we should close a school and replace its staff"(Berlin 11-12). Many people say that achievement offer test and they can know how much they have achivement through test. "But "ahievement" means more than a score on a standardized test"(Berlin 15). Achievement can be process. Even the test scores are not good, if people do study hard and they do best on their tests. Then it doesn''t matter how many scores do they got. Process will cover everything include test scores. "Achievement is more than test scores but also includes class participation, sutdents'' course-taking patterns, and teachers'' professional develop patterns"(Berlin 20-22).\r\n	For these reasons, students should take standardized test and know their ablity through score, but they have know it is not only way to have achievement. I would like to say students who are taking tests. Just best on your tests that you can and even the scores are bad, you can try again until you become sucess. It is more help to follow the next level. \r\n\r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\nFisher, Charlie. "Standardized Tests." Health Studies Reader. Ed.

In the world that we live in, there is a constant need of work force despite of qualified one, since after the Industrial Revolutions the society started to be based on a overwhelming need of constatnt production. The governments couldnt continue to give the same effective old fashion education, they had to implement a new prespective of academic avaluation, a prepective that would folow the needs of production, would be educate people fast and would have standardized knownleadge that could be applied to the critical points of industrial development.\r\n	In a first instance, we might look banck into history to see where this educational prepecrtive began. According to Charlie Fisher in Standardized testing " [m]ost historians trace the beginning of standardized testoing to seventh-century China, when the government began administering written exams to select candidates for government service", this test continue to be used by the "Chinese National Higher Edication Entrance Examinations, commmonlly called the Gaokao"(Fisher). This test have been used to certify that all chinese students whith the intention to go to a higher education are preparated to deal with the academic world. However, the extensive knowleadge requiered, is a constant pressure to schools to preparate their students to a succesful path, therefore intensive study practices are applied. Furthermore, such intensive study only dosen''t demonstrate signs to problems to most of use since all of them give the same argument " it is for their good", so based on this misleading preception of what is good for each individual governments such as the US started to follow a similar way, and in 1845 standardized tests were applied.\r\n	The standerdized tests that were inplemented in 1845 in the US evolved to the current SAT''s , however with the years they are demonstrating signs on unefficiency. The main reason of the implementation of the SAT''s was the the impacts of the an incresing number of foreigner getting into Americans schools, and to attend to such demand Standerdized test were applied to better qualify the students ( Fisher). The implementation of this tests were a succes during the first decades, but with the called war and the hunger of going beyomd our planet, the bases of this testing were shaken, as a consequenquence of " SAT''s scores had been falling since 1963". Based on this permissive content there is no surprise that the US government took measures to balance the situation, yet uneffective sice the American educational sistem promote, to some extent, the criativity of the students and this is for sure the reason for the folling of SAT''s average. \r\n	However, all the educational problems worldwide are based in the same problem, the lack of ability of the current governments in respond to the simple quention,  what is achivement? For centuries achivement was to have a good family, being honest and have friends, and with a better look to this era, where big names such as Galileu Galilei were born, education was rudimentar and in some parts unexistent but the criativity was influenced and we could distinguish an apple and a blueberry, and the few schools that existed in that era helped on it. Nowadays the education in all and each countrie is based in a type of exam, were all your life depends on a inteligence test that is there to test everything but not inteligence. Furthermore, achivements in the modern days is a synonyme to good scores in tests, and this is correct? Is correct to test peoples with the more wide interests in the same bases, only because there is a need to put them to work?  Well I have my convictions that it should be reviewed, as Thomas Berlin points in HOW DO YOU DEFINE ACHIVEMENT,  "it''s time to look a little harder at what these tests actually can and cannot do", experience have showed that in every single class in the world there is people tha simply "copy and paste" entire books into their heads  only for a test and after that they " click on delete" and the fact is that peolpe like this have A''s and the real smart guy that is learning is having C''s, and consequently all the credit will be given to a pearson that in reality dosen''t deserve such credits making all our society based in fake ideals of great achivement, therefore it is not correct to judge a school achivement by the results of their students since they al different and a good score on a test can be a synonyme of nothing.\r\n	Notwithstanding, the fact that its hard to teach billions of children the basics , we are generating robots instead of people. During our youth twe are told that we must study, we must be good at school, however we forgot that we are all different, yet we forget that the way our society is created we can create a "pyramid of knownleadge" where in the top of all we have Math, Physics, cheminstry and all industry focus subjects, in the middle is social sciences and in the bottom is art, all because there is a need to implement standardized test along with the extensive need of generate "qualified" work force, which is the main focus point, so there is a need to have good schools working, well have schools that give good scores. Standardized  tests are good for it, are good to demonstrate that we have the knownleadge to go to work, therefore the application of it is incorrect since the measure of the abilyties of a pearson in a test lead to untrusty results due to the diverense ability of people to develop ideas and concepts about some topics. Furthermore, this need to certify somenone in the bases of the industrial world is creating robots, robots that dont see nothing wromg to achive goals, to be good and be succesful, in part it is fault of a standardized educational system that is helping the degradation of the human side of humanity, and the school is bing forced to it since it is required that each school use all the resources to default students with good scores, yet the role of a school in the world is to teach people not preparete them to a test. So a school should be more conceraned with creating good people instead of create computer with legs, which need to have good scors to their good and the school.\r\n	All in all, we must realize that standerdized test are just a way to enhance the capitalized world we live in, a way that the governments found to redefine our achivements "[b]ut achivement means more than a score on a standerdized test" (Berlin), achivment is simply a word that suggests that we must follow the best in us, not base our live in a test based in what the world think we should know. Therefore, it is not correct to classify the quality of a school by the scors of their students since people are different, they learn differently and a good school isn''t good to all students.\r\n', '00:10:58', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '10.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.5', '1.0', '3.0', '10.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.00', '2.25', '2.25', '1.50', '2.50', '10.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

However, some students might have different abilities in something which they are interested in, so this kind of test might not fit for them. For example, if you were in China, you must need to have a higher score on Gaokao becasue your school would depend on this examination (Fisher). Therefore, people should not just use standardized tesing score to know student''s abilities because everyone must have different interest. People not only can basie on standardized test, but also can have achievement.\r\n	Standardized test makes students bulid their abilities. Knowledge is the fundation for human bing, so it can help students in the future. Chinese students are a good example because their education will depend on their Goaokao score, so they need to study harder, but in the same time, they will gain more knoeledge in order to haev more abilities for the future (Fisher). Although standardized test wiil make student can not have many chances to have more activities because they they do not have time, but we can see the result  that is good for students.\r\n	Achievement has ability to make some students study in the future. People are not only just to see a score in order to have a school becasue they want to have more materials to see what the student look like, this test will help them to understand more things which is about students (Berlin). However, students should have more motivations in their classes becasue their score will depend on their participation. It is necessary to know what is the way that student want to go in the future, so teachers have the duty to help students to develop their abilities. Thus, people can use different way to know what is the next step in their future.\r\n	It is better to have different kinds of classes to make students understand knowledge. If schools have more different kinds of classes, students are able to have a opportunity to try what they like. This multiple-education will bulid student''s abilities, and it will help them a lot in the future because it is also a chance to train themseleves. They must need to know what is the best solution for them, but it is not not juts to follow what other people''s thinking. A score might be important for their school, but if they do not think more possibilities for temselves, their future will not ne perfect enough.\r\n	Students have diefferent interest, so it is necessary to have different way to help them. If people were able to mix up the education systems of China and the U.S., it would will perfect because students not only could increase their knowledge, but also would understnad what is the best way for them. Students will have better education if people can accomplish this goal in the future.  Itis a chance that people should have revolution in order to have different education system becsuae standardized test has been used in China for many centuries (Fisher). Therefore, in my opinion, standardized test is not the best one for students becasue it will limite their future, so I think multiple- educationis a better system for students.

The records of the history states that the China started to use the result of the test in 1700 to evaluate the persons who want to work in the government department and since that time, many other countries in the world have been using the tests score to determine the persons who will be accepted in the jobs or the the students who will accepted to study at the universities(Fisher). Nevertheless, is the test the best way to evaluate the schools or students? Is there any possibility that it is wrong method to konw the real level of the school? The schools should not be judged by standardized test scoores because this method will not represents the real level of the schools and it will destroy the creativity of the schools.\r\n	First of all, It is unfear to make the the scores of the test the only method to evaluate the role and the activity of the school because they  are more than that (Thomas Berline). The school is consist of many factors that should be taken in our consedration if we want to evaluate it. Forexample, there is the rate of the students attending at the shoole for the whole year of study, the efforts that the teachers are giving to improve the understanding of the students in this schools, and the variety of the lessons that are given by the teachers (Berline). On the other hand, there are some countries like China which make their schools constrate on improving the skill of their students on the doing a specific types of tests and that why they are taking the best scores at these tests (Fisher). Therefore, the focusing on doing the test is not agood tool to measure the shool''s level and will destroy the real goals of the school which are the education and knowledge.\r\n	 Secondly, professor Kam Wing Chan who is teaching geography at  Washington University thinks that the school should not make the children care just about the scores that they should take in the tests because that will destroy the independant cleverness of these children, reduce their desire to descover the factc in the different science, and kill their imagination (Fisher). We can lose many of the talent students because we are depending only on the test which could by a big problem to these students because it make them confused and get panic and there are many examples in the history about persons who failed in their study but thee became famous in a specific branch of science. Thus, one of the school'' Jobs is to looking for these talents and working on developing there skill and talents to produce a project of scientest to the society.\r\n	In conculsion, the school should not be evaluted just depending on the test scores that their students takes; there are many other factors should be taken in consediration to give the school its real performance assisment and to allow it to do one of its real goals which is finding the talents and improving them.', '00:00:00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '13.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '14.5', '3.00', '2.50', '3.00', '3.00', '2.50', '14.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Today, standartized tests are commonly used to measure students achievement and measure weather a school can educate students on the best way. These kind of tests seek for students academic capacity on specific areas of knowledge. This means that on these tests have only specific questions from a specific area, and they do not measure the criativity capacity of students beyond conventional knowledge. Because of this, some researchers and educators have questioned weather they can measure students'' achievement. All in all, knowledge is more than score from a standart test. These tests cannot classified wether school is good or not, because they are tests for specific area, and they do not measure how students will use knowledge to do something beyond the conventional.\r\n\r\n	Standart tests only measure specific knowledge without relate them with what students can do. In standart tests students can find many question for specific problems. In them, the students will try to answer question from specific subject without necessarely to relate them with real life problem. Students who get very good score on these tests not necessarely can use knowledge from specific areas in real life or to make a new product for real life. Also, these tests cannot measure wether a school educates students for real life. Paraphrasing what professor Chang said, US education encourage students explore knowledge beyond the conventional(Charlie).Also, Chang said: "It is the openness and criativity of American system..."(Charlie). He said this to contrast with chinese education which stimulate children to focus on a specific subject. What he said means that to explore knowledge is more important that scores from a test.\r\n\r\n	Student achievement measurement cannot to be made from standart tests. Student achievement measure is not easy task to do. As the economist Richard Rothsteis said: " Measurement of student achievement is complex-too complex for the social science methods presently available"(Thomas). Student achienvement cannot be measured only making students taking a test. It evolve many factors, as Gutierrez said, the own test scores and class participation, students'' course-taking patterns, and teachers and plrofessional development patterns(Thomas). All this involved contribute to student achievement meaurement. So, just stantard test cannot measure wether school and students are on right path to get knowledge. The government and secretary of education should revise the consept of ranking school based on test scores. They should look for a new way to test education from school and student capacity. As suggestion, they could send educational agents to see and investigate how a school involve students with knowledge for real life. Based on relatories from this investigation, the governement could conclude wether a school is working well or not.\r\n\r\n	Thus, standart tests cannot effectivelly measure wether school is working well or wether student is going well on using knoweledge. The schools should be ranked based on how they work for students use knowledge for real life.

The first article discusses the farming methods that people used to do in the past and the new method called organic farming. Whereas, the second article illustrates different experimentals that have been done on meat and some kind of fruts and vegitables. In fact, people prefer the traditional way of farming because the previous gereration used that without any diffeculties. But having a new method is something appreciated especially if it is safer than what they got to use. Therefore, it is ethical to swhich to the new the new farming method because it prodects out evironment and provides best value in terms of profitability.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, having clean environment is something that many people can claim as step to safe surces. Wheher he or she is using chemical to grow planets or being able to use the new techniques such as organig farming, people should care about the mian sources such as soial. We actually have limit sources and it is our job to think deeply about to reduce the use of those nonrenewable sources. According to David Fisher " Organic agriculture does not use artificial fertilizer or chemical pesticides, and it does not pollute the environment.", it is clear that using organic agriculture is safe soial. For example, frind of mind has farm and every year he changes the area where the vegitable graw. The reason behaind that he is not able to use the same place more than time and by the end when he used all areas, he quite the farming due to the soial damage. Therefore, nonrenewable sources are limit and it is doable to look for alternative methods such as organic farming method. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, people tend to talk a lot about the organic farming and the advantages or disadvanteges of that, but we do not hear as much concerning about the profitability. This is called the value of nutrations and there are no negative effects. Indeed, organic foods are safey and health based on the David Fisher in his atricle "Organic Farming". While, James Berlin, the author for the second article says cosuomers can have their options regardless organic and nonorganic according to Stanford researchers. Having safe products allows buyer to choice any farming products. For instance, I something struggle to choice between organic and nonorganic especially if the discussion about the price as I have limit funds, but I normally force myself with orgaic due to the value that I gain from organic foods. I also hear the same discussion among coubles especially in front of banana table at different supermarkets.\r\n\r\nEven though some people agree that organic are more expersive than nonorganic foods because farmer put more efforts in orgarnic farming method, many people are looking for healthy food and they catogrize that as first periority for tham. People are happy with traditional farming until traditional agriculture has been adopted by different material. Increasing the number of diseases such as cancer made people start to rethink about that in order to protect their life.\r\n\r\nIn coclusion, interduce a new method of farming is very diffecult unless this method is totally safe and healthy. The concept was not accepted until severial hypothieses have been proved. Thus, It is moral to welcome the eniter idea because it safe our limit sources and it nutritional value.

Additionally,the chemical with limited concentation ,that used as a firtilizers in the conventinal farming can not be worest than the organic firtalizers and it''s bacteria like E.coli (Berlin).Therefore.and for this three reason this articl is against the organic farming especially from the health side.\r\n	Finally,the organic farming is only a way to markiting and advertise for a local products for specific markets only.When you compear the prices of the organic farming products with prices of traditional products,you can find a large differance in prices between them.Moreover, if you focuse on the organic farming indestury, you can see that this indestury are only for local markets and each country or state has a specific markets for this.From this point the essay acn erpresant thet the organic farming is a way the encarege the people to by this product.Advertisments but in diffrant ;way they combine the health information and the bad sid effacts of the chemicals in fertilizers and pesticides then they announced about thier products.Fisher in his articl amphasise that the organic farming products are markets localislly and their distributin is onlly for a specific erea.This specific limitation for these products with the owners advertizmants about how it is diffrant and how it is healther and a way from chemichal,give the owners the right to ingreas the prises as they want.Moreover the inplausible diffrance can be distegushed between the organic and traditional farming.Berlin mention this facts in his articl and says that the organic faming is " amarkiting tool" that let the people to overbuy these products.\r\n	in sum,becouse the aggreculture is the essential sourse for the energy and human life,the changes in the ways and the tools and the products to improve it becom dramaticlly fase, The use of fertilizers and pesticides and others were made to imrove the quality and the quantiity.And inspit of it sid effect on the health and enveroment, these teqnologies still important.On the other hand, som people try to use these side effects to marketing their own product expoit the side effacts and the human concerning about health.', '00:00:00', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '10.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '10.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.00', '2.00', '2.00', '2.25', '2.00', '10.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Consequently with the industrial revolution and subsequent technological evolution, new methods were introduced into farming. Methods as hormonal changes, artificial perticides and heavy machinary that allow farmers to produce bigger crops. However the usage of such methods influence in the final quality of the product, which aquire certain residual pesticides and due to some hormonal manipulation during production, anihilate the biodiversity arround the area of production, yet the consequences of this manipulation on humans are uncertain. For the reasons above, i shall argue that there is reasons to support conventional and organic farming approach.\r\n	In a first instance, with overpopulated world that we live into, conventional farming became crucial since it is a more efficient way of farming in atuality, moreover it is evident that despite the environmental impact it is needed. First, the heavy machinary used in conventional farming, which are focused of on a biased debate about the environmental impact of it, is justifiable since they help farmers to produce enough food for everyone. In addition, some belief that the food produced in conventional farming is rather less nutritious, but a research made by Standford University demostrated that this point is rather false since the percentageof nutrients found in products produced from both conventional and organic farming didn''t differ much (Berlin). Therefore conventional farming products seam to be a better choice, their are cheaper and doesn''t present a significant difference with organic products. In addition some belief that the artificial fertilizers used in conventional farming, are harmful to the consumers, since they are strong chemicals, yet they stick to the products, so they don''t know to which extent this residual chemicals can influence in a decrease of health quality. Notwithstanding this point scientists pointed tha most of the times the pesticides residues found on food are between the pardorns seen as harmless to humans, which are set by the Environmental Protection agency (Berlin). With this evidence it becomes clear that the products that result from conventional farmin are indeed safe.\r\n	On the other hand, organic farming suporters point that the conventional approach of farming is harmful to the consumers, and more than that put the balance of the farm ecossistem in jeopardy. The supporters of this cause say that organic farming is about harmony with the natural systems, rather than harm them (Fisher). Consequently this naturalistic approach successed in keepinh the natural process of farming, helping the environment, consequently nature become a crucial part of production. In addition with the lack of machineray used in organic farming, a bigger workforce is needed, so that bigger and cleaner crops can be created, and with a bigger work force more families are happy. Notwithstanding this the main aspect of organic farming is that "[o]rganic food aims to be of optimum nutricional, and virieties and methods of production are geared  to this end" (Fisher). The naturalistic approach of this method bring into the products a higher percentage of natural minerals to the food, with the advantage of not having residial pesticides. This aspect increases the of the food, it is a fact, however the benefits that they bring to our helth are remarcable, consequently the price of these goods cant be a factor to take prestige of organic faming since it only justifies the quality oof the good. Furthermore the modern food industry is based upon consumerism and profitaility, resulting in a lack of care about the consumer, but in organic farming the naturalistic approach is used to thinking in the costumer and the benefits within the food ( Fisher). Benefits as nutritional value and the costumer health, aspects that the modern food industry is lacking in adressing. In addition it is a fact that the modern food industry is overproducing, due to the inhability in distribute their  goods worldwide, as a consequence of this approach polution is increasing as well as the impact of it in the world ecosystem. In addition organic farming uses overproducted food to fertilize new corps, and another "suggested solution to the problem ... is to produce crops that can be turned into energy such as ethanol" (Fisher). This solution is very useful since it dont only help to decrease food waste but it also creates a green energy that can be used as biodisel, decreaseing the usage of non-renovable energies.\r\n	Notwithstanding, the arguments above it is clear that organic farming is a better way to produce food. It is a fact tha the modernfood industry is not focused in distribute healthy food, on the contrary they are focused in make people addicted to fast food, in order to generate bigger profits. But in organic this problem doesn''t exist since the crops produce by it are focused in create quality food that in fact help people to live better and healthier, yet the nutricional value between organic and non-organic food can have smal differences, but the prevalence of pesticides residues in non-organic food crates a relevat point against it, since can not point what are the consequences or benefits of this residues. Thus agriculture is one of the activities that polutes more our planet, and any action made in order to decrease this impact is a benefict for all us. Therefore is it clear that organic farming is indeed a better and wiser approach to farming.\r\n	In brief, some people belief that conventional farming is a better approach due to the ability in distribute a bigger amount of food as well as a being less expensive. Others belief that organic farming is a wiser approach to farming due to the naturalistic approach that it follows as well as the healhier life that helps to built. However both approach have pros and cons and the one which have a better impact in health and in the environment is undoubtly the wiser path to follow.', '00:20:59', '3.0', '3.5', '3.5', '3.0', '3.0', '16.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '3.0', '12.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '3.00', '2.75', '2.50', '3.00', '14.25', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Food in gerenal comes in many forms such vegetables and fruits. All of this food need to be grown by skilled farmers and they are different forms of farming methods such as Conventional farming and Organic farming. Conventional farming is commonly known as industrial method of farming were bulk of produce is grown with the help of chemical pesticide, chemical weedicide and artificial fertilizers so that the plants grow faster then there natural rate whereas organic farming is to be known as a more healthier form of farming were very less to no chemical pesticide ,chemical weedicide and artificial fertilizer is used thus the plants grow accordingly with the nature. Organic farming works in hand to hand with the environment in peace then in the oppositions like Conventional farming does with the natural system (Fisher). Moreover organic farming is a more better form of farming compared to the Conventional methods of farming, as it is more healthier and safer to eat for the consumers and the environment.\r\n\r\n          Organic farming has changed many peoples view on the concept eating healthier. Organic food has less to no traces of chemical pesticide thus it can be said that orgainc produces are very healthy to consume due to its contents of more nurtients and  no chemicals (Berlin). Organic food are to be said to have more taste them Conventional farming produces. Coventional farming uses many different types of chemicals for the ealry growth of vegetables but in the long run the trace of the chemical are left behind in the produces thus giving them a more blunt and dull taste and due to this fact more and more people prefer to purchase organic vegetables and fruites over Conventional farming products (fisher). \r\n\r\n          Furthermore, Organic farming is also very safe to consume due to the less to no chemical contents and Organic farming is also said to be very environmental friendly aswel. Organic farming is to be a more substainable form of farming were the use of nonrewenable form of energy is very much encouraged such solar energy, wind mills, biogas and many other forms of energy which are very benefical to the environment (Fisher). All this form of substainable energy are extremely benefical to the modern growing world where there is so much pollution and gobal worming occuring. Nonrewenable energy also holds the solution to the problem of overproducation were many of the produces go to waste but it can be used to make ethanol and ethane (biogas) which is a form energy used in cooking gas and to make clean energy in the form of electricity without the use of fossil fuels (Fisher). This form of energy plays an very vital part in the developing world were there is an overusage of fossils fuel which is a major contributing factor to gobal warming therefore this form of clean energy can be used in the modern world to run cars and towns for days without affecting the environmnet.\r\n\r\n          Finially it can be said that organic farming holds the key to a more safer and healthier world and it is a step forward to the future where there is less pollution and a more cleaner environmnet. Organic eating has became a major part of many peoples lifes in the growing years due to its increasing popularity among the new more health concern generation.

It''s very important to know how to deal with your problem because dealing with problems is the only step to success beside hard working which I consider a problem that I''m still not successful. But on the other hand with the organic farming, the type of farming that tackling problem is the biggest consept they work on when they practice.\r\n\r\n             An organic farmer always knows what what should he do with the extra products, but a traditional farmer might directly send it to the garbedge. An organic farmer who has extra products, the first thing he will do is to see if this product can be used as a source of energy or not, if yes, then he would use it for his machienes or take it where it can be used, as an example of that the ethanol. But if that thing cannot be used as an energy source, then he would take it back to they same soil it came from. So, this kind of farming can be considered more efficint.\r\n\r\n             Stanford University scientists have studied about why people prefer products that have been made organicly over products that have been made traditionally. Dr. Dena Bravata said "When we began this project, we thought that there would likely be some findings that would support the superiority of organics over conventional food," This sentence is a clue that they didn''t find any benefits of organic farming, and they aslo said that fruits and vegitables ,which are labeled organic, are on average, which means it''s not healthier it''s just the same as fruits and vegitables that are made traditionally, so why is the overpaying on the hormons and additives.\r\n\r\n             For the end, maybe scientists said that it has no differnces but it really has a lot of humaity differences, as a human I would rather paying few more cents than wasting food, and organic agriculture also focuses on making things simple more than making it sophisticated. So, why don''t scientists who have a lot of knowledge or anyone else think twice before saying that it doesn''t have differences but it''s more expansive. \r\n\r\n             ', '00:04:20', '1.0', '1.0', '1.0', '2.0', '2.0', '7.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.0', '1.0', '1.0', '1.0', '2.0', '6.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.00', '1.00', '1.00', '1.50', '2.00', '6.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Nowadays, it is know that traditional agriculture has been involved in a lot of problems, such as using great amounts of chemicals to control the insects  and fertilizers to make the vegetables and fruits grow faster (Fisher, 1). In a effort to improve the agriculture, the governments have created new regulations about the use of chemicals, such as pesticides and fertilizers and have given loads and subsidies to the farmers; however these methods have just given a temporary solution to the great problem. Therefore, even though the all efforts that farmers have made using new methods and new technology, the problems are still present and increasing everyday.  Besides, people claim about the "tastelessness of food" and the harmful substances used in the farm which increase the concern of people and their families (Fisher, 1 ). On the other hand, another side of farming has grown greatly, the controversial organic farming which state that it is concern about the industry and consumer interests at the same time (Fisher, 1). This new practice of farming has gained a lot of supporters, which state organic food is a promise of a new style of life, because it care about "health, the nutritional value and safety" (Fisher, 1). As a new way of agriculture, organic farming is more expensive than the conventional and is needed more knowledge; however, it is a wise alternative of farming, because it does not use chemicals and does not pollute the environment, which is good for all the population. \n\n\n\n\n ', '01:15:41', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '1.0', '2.0', '9.0', '2.0', '1.0', '1.0', '0.0', '2.0', '6.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '2.00', '1.50', '1.50', '0.50', '2.00', '7.50', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

One of the directions they have been looking recently is the healthy side of live and with it healthy food. Over the yeas people have been thinking in ways to make their lives healthyer and after some thinking the organic farming rises. The organic farming is a way of farming that does not use harmful substances in their crops and that is in complit harmony with the environment. Organic farming is a wise alternative to conventional farming because it healthy and it does not prejudicate the environment.\r\n\r\n	Organic farming is a health chose to everyone. Organic farmers want to make their food great in nutritional valeu (Fisher) and to do that they count with the nature help. According to David Fisher, in organic farming, oil is used to synthesize pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Organic farming only uses natuaral fertilizers and pesticides, what diminish the possibility of harmful substances in the food they provide. As a result "organic food is living up to its promise", according to Sonya Lunder (Berlin). \r\n\r\n	Another reason to support the idea that organic farming is a better alternative to conventional farming is that it is also a "friend" of the environment. According to David Fisher, organic farming is a "philosophy of live" (Fisher), where agriculture is in harmony with the environment. In the conventional farming residual poisons, whith are substances that endanger other living criatures, are relise to the enviromente, while in organic farming, those posions are not necessary (Fisher). In addition, organic farming agricultural wast products are created in a way that they post no harm to the environment, while in the conventional farming that does not happend and the agricultural wast products affect the environment severly (Fisher). \r\n\r\n	As we can see the current way of farming is no better them the organic way. Poeple are looking more and more for a healthy livestlyle and  the organic farming can give them that. Organic farming is the fist step towards a better future, where Mankind can have a healthy life and live in harmony with the environment.

But they are scared of what they don not know. So, they try to find out by gussing. They sometimes say that orgamic food are unhealthy. Not because it is really unhealthy. But because it is new thing that they have not lived with. However, organic farming is a wise alternative to conventional farming because it is healthier for our bodies and for the food itself. \r\n	\r\n	Organic farming is the best way for food to help our bodies to be healthier. "Practitioners of organic agriculture adopt an approach that minimizes the use of nonrenewable sources of energy. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are either synthesized from oil or they require larger amount of oil to extract and process them. It seems extraordinary that food production, a method of actually producing energy, or rather of tapping the sun''s abundant energy, has itself developed into a bulk user of energy source. It is even more extraordinary that one suggested solution to the problem of overproduction is to produce crops that can be turned into energy as ethanol" (Fisher) Moreover, people think that organic food which has chemicals will kill them. However, not all chemicals is danerous, our bodies already have chemicals and there are chemicals that helps our bodies and brains. Therefore, organic farming is helpful for people''s health.\r\n	\r\n	additionaly, organic farming helps plants to grow. A research tells the best fuits and vegetables are in the organic farms, 63 percent of sub-Saharan farmers in Africa are organic and of North Amrican farmers is 73 percents (fisher)  So, organic farming has been better way to farmers to preduce and increase their farms. So, plants were dying because of some diseases from which organic farming could product. Berlin, James said that scientists in Stanford University thought conventional strawberry has more vitamin C than organic food. However, when they examed the fruit, they have found bacteria K on conventional one, which is dangerous bacteria (Berlin) So, even if conventional food seems better, they are danderous sometimes. Consequently, organic usually make healthier food and healthier plants growth. \r\n	\r\n	In conclusion, because organic farming is healthier for our bodies and plants, it is a wise to conventional farming. Organic farming is the way that we can help ourselves with to be healthy and to keep our food healthy. So, when farmers have orgamic farms they will preduce good food we can help ourselves with.

They want to get a healthy food that will not have a bad effect on them. Many problems have accured in agriculture recently, and it is increasing inread of decresing. People have been trying to find a solution for this huge problem and they think they did, although it has become a controversy among people. So, this controversy idea about the farming methods that people have been arguing about recently. has devided people. There are some people say that the new method of farming which it is called organic farming, is a really healthy way to produce food.  In addition, they think that it is the philosophy of life, a natural system that will help in facing agriculture difficulties. On the other hand, there are people who say that the traditional way of farming is much better than the new one which it is strongly right because of a couple of reasons. First, it causes environmental pollution ,and Second, it affects our health.\r\n\r\n	First, the organic farming method can easily causes a pollution around the world especially in the countrysides . This new method of farming need to use many kind of pesticides so that it can help them prduce there food. Furtheremore, these pesticides will not only have bad impact on our food, but also on animals, planets, and insects. For instance, when animals get harm because of thses harmful liquds, they will die or become sick easily. Moreover, a lot of insects that help in growning some kind of food will die which is going to affect on food growing. They also say that when they use these chemicals, they will provide an energy to the food. This energy will produce somethimg call ethanol which will affect the food grown and it can be not healthy So, pesticides as you can see can facilitate the process of destroying the food system.\r\n\r\n	Second,  the new method of farming will help in destroying our health and make it worse. Organic food farmers use some kind of chemicals that affect the quality of food. These harmful chemicals will make their food looks very delicious and that will attract more people to buy it. Morever, these substances will make the food grow faster so that they can harve it faster and sell it. All these methods will have bad outcomes on our health, we will get many kind of diseases that hard to treat. One of the mose sepread diseases that people can get is cancer. For instance, people in the past did not use any kind of substances on theit food.

Nawadays, People consern about their health and try to make their choices wisely. While many people think they need to eat organic foods to be healty, this is not true.\r\n	Firstly, people buy organice foods, because they are thinking it contain more vitamins. In fact, James Berlin, writing in this aticle, "Standford Scientists Cast Doubt on Advantages of organic Neat and Produce", points out resilts, which found by scientists of Stanford University, prove that "fruits and vegetables labeled organic were, on average, no more nutritious then their conventional counterparts" (Berlin). He adds that even the scientists were surprised by this information (Berlin). This study is realy valubel, since it shows that there is no extra nutritious in organic foods. Thus, there is no reason to buy organic foods, since its have as much vitamins and nutrition as conventional ones.\r\n		Secondly, some people beilive that organic foods have better quality than others. This idea is based on what organic agricultur aims to be. David Fisher, writing in this artical, "Organic Farming Versus Traditional Farming Methods", says that when organic agriculture started, it aims to have foods with better quality (Fisher). He adds that "the modern food industry is oriented toward its own interests-food storage life, impact on cinsumers, and profitability-not tgose of the consumer: nutritional value, health, and safety" (Fisher). On the other hand, the study results shows that is not true (Berlin). People buy organic foods, because advertisment and marketing offering these kind of foods as a healthy choices. In addtion, orgainc foods could be contaminated by harmful bacteria (Berlin). Therefore, people do not have to buy orgnic foods.\r\n	 Finaly, organice foods are much more expensive than convention. Life cost is incresed, and people must make their dicistion wisdly. Why they spend their money to pay orgaince foods? There is no need for that. There is not any advantige from buying orgaince foods. Organic fruits, vegetables, and meat do not have any health advantages (Berlin). By compering the cost of organice foods and conventional ones, organice foods are much expemsive (Berlin). For that reasons, it is better for people to spent their money in something worth more than organic foods, because the study prove that organice foods not aboult health, but about markiting consept.\r\n	In conculsion, organice foods are more about marketing consept than a heath choice.

Organic agriculture is a new way and it seemns to have a lot of advantages but some people argue that, for them traditional farming is steel good enough and they do not what to change. Therefore organic food has won a lot of fans that argue that, for them it has a lot more to offer than traditional agriculture. In my oppinion traditional farming is old and it has been not improved, in the other hand organic farming has fresh ideas that help humans to be healthier and mantain our world without all the harm traditional farming makes. \r\n	\r\n	Agriculture is facing a lot of problems ("Fisher"), it seems to be harmful for the planet and it does not help humans to improve their health, in addition some times it seem to harm humans too. Traditional farming uses a lot of toxic substances that are not good for humans, this toxic substances helps the plnats grow fast and big but it seem to be tasteless ("fisher"). This type of farming not only makes harm to people but to the earth too, all the syntetic pesticides, hormones and addictives affect the land and makes contamination grow. As matter of fact organic farming is the opposit because not only it is beneficial for humans but it also tastes good. A great fact of organic farming is that it also makes energy, like ethanol ("Fisherl"). Traditional farming is way less expensive but it does not has all the advantages organic farming has, so  the price is worth it ("Berlin"). \r\n\r\n	Stanford University has shown in a research that traditional farming friuts and vegetables contain pesticides but the level is under the allowed safety limits ("Berlin"). Other thing that mabye not all the fans of organic farming know is that it does not have more nutrients than the traditional one. However, in my opinion it does not matter if friuts and vegetables of traditional farming  have the same quantity of nutrients because is traditional farming, as a matter of fact is in some way it hurts humans because of all the harmful substances. As stated before organic farming does not use any of those substances and at least all of the products are more natural. \r\n\r\n	Organic farming has a lot of benefits for both humans and enviroment.

Without the food there is not life on our earth. So the people depabd on agriculture to get food .the agriculture was simple in past where the farmers used a simple tool in agriculture . But increasing number of people became needing to use modern technology to develop the agriculture for alleviating fame that exist in some countries . Organic farming consider one solution for this problem that the people face today ,espcially thrid world . Althought some people thing that conventional foods stay better than organic food , organic foods have several postive benfits for people because of health and saftey Good taste \r\n\r\n 	First of all one reasons than Organic food is beneficial is Health . Ortganic food has nutritional vaule where large amount from vitamin, carbohydrate  and protin . the organic food considerable contribute in spending on alot of  disease such as  heat attack , blood high presure and dibetes from addtion some nessesary  to food .  The organic food can elimnate from  harmful matrials that cause problem of obesity for people (Fisher). but some resarcher noticed that organic food does not have health benfits in meats ,and is not more nutritious that conventional agriculture. (Berlin).\r\n\r\n	The second reason that oraganic food is important is safty . the oraganic foods does not cause polltion of environment. pesticide and feritilizers use in growing the organic food . This will contribute in getting on clean envirnoment clear from plloutiom .Fisher siad that "Organic agriculture does not use arifical fertilzer or chemical pesticides and it does not pollute the enviroment " . The factors will make the enviroment more safeand  it make .but some researcher thing that conventional food is also safey where conventional agriculture do not use  more chemical pestcides  and level use the pesticide do not damage people. ( Berlin) \r\n\r\n      laterly . the organic food has good taste . In organic agreculture btain add Alot of materals that make the food is very delcious from conventional food . The farmer can control in method of production fruit and vegetables by addtion some substances to produce For example When I buy organic food like fruit and vegetable  to market . I feel have  taste better than  conventional food  such as watermilon, orange ,Apple ,all this friut is sweet flavor and good tast . \r\n\r\nin conclotion . the organic agriculture will stay from important needs for people becouse it have alot of postive advantages haelthy and saftey and good taste . I think that organic agrculture will increase so mush dut to increse of population.

However, both of these different kinds of farming have advantages and disadvantages. In fact, the policies of agricurals has to decide which type of farming should farmers use. Also to decide which one is better so they have to look and the advantages and the disadvantages of everyone of these organic farming and traditional farming, then choose the one with less, simple disadvantages. \r\n 	\r\n	First of all, there are alot of advantages and disadvantages of traditional farming, But the most noteciable  thing is that their disadvantages are very harmful. For exapmle, one them is the useing of the chemical pesticides and herbocides. In fact, these methods came from nonrenwable sources, souch as oil. Consequently, these methods are polluted to the envirnoment. Actually, that methods are full of energy (Fisher). However, bsides the full energy some tradional farming are suffering from overprudction, and "one suggested solution" to this problem is by producing more craps that become type of energy like, ethanol (Fisher).  Moreover, eating crops that have growed by using pesticides, without washing them very carfully, may couse a awful disease to the human''s health.\r\n\r\n	First of all, one of the advantages of the organic farming is less polluted to the envirnment and saves living organs livies. Becouse of  the methods that the traditional farming use. Moreover, these methods are poison to the living things besides humans (Fisher). On the other hand, organic farming dicline the using of those methods, which made of nonrenwable sources, so it saves the envirnment, gives the crops more nutritional value and dose not threat the life of the living things (Fisher). Thus, Organic farming is much better than the traditional farming. \r\n\r\n	In addition, no more contaning of vitamins do the crops of organic farming have. This is the disadvantage of organic food. In fact, some scientists claimed that by giving and example about the vitamin C in organic strawberry (Berlin). Furthermore, the reserchers submit that  " no obvious health advantages to organic meats." (Berlin). thus, this is a similar thing between these to diffirent types of farming. In spit of this disadvantage, organic farming is still better than traditional farming. In other words, eating organic food that contant the same nutrions are better than the food that have treated by polluted methods and my ley you to serious diseases. \r\n\r\n	In conclusion, organic farming is better than traditional farming becaouse it saves people''s health, makes the evirnment less polluted. Hence, agricultural policy should get rid of traditionsl farming and gives the rights to use organic farming instead of traditional farming.

Berlin James claims that organic food its more likely seen as way to pay more and help the farmers and the market, rather than help the consumer by giving food with an healthier quality of production without synthetic pesticides or additives. However, organic farming is increasing in their number of consumers because poeple wants to have a healthier meal wihtout worrying about the impact for consuming any product made by the traditional farming methods containing hormones, fertilizers, and any other residues. Organic farming is a wise alternative to coventional farming because food contains less chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and reduce the use of energy sources such as oil.\r\n\r\n	One of the biggest concerns in these days is the consume of any product containing pasticides, which are harmful or poisoness for the human body. David Fisher said "Organic agriculture aims to be in harmony, rather than in conflict, with naturals systems." This means that organic farming is processing all their products with enourmus caution to  earn the consumers trust and make them buy the organic product. Consumers are more likely to worry about what the food could contains such as pollutants that are harmful for the human body. However David Fisher claims ''''This idea pervades all aspetcs of an organic farm, from how pest and diseases are controlled, through the treatment of livestock and integration of the farm with the natural environment, to marketing, labor relations, and health." He is proving that organic food is the most accurate and wise solution for any cosnumer who wants to taste a good and heatlty product.\r\n\r\n	In the year 2015 everybody is worry about the use of some energy sources such as oil which can only be use one time in their life because is a nonrenewable source. Oil is use to make the pesticides or any chemical used for the porpuse of controlling pest, or in order to mantain the products in a good state for long time, even to give a good look of the product to make it more good looking for the consumer but the solution that organic farmers are proving is more than just one, as an example David Fisher explains " It seems extraordinary that food production, a mehtod of actually producing energy, or rather of tapping the sun''s abundant energy, has itself developed into a bulk user of energy sources."  Is simple changing the traditional farming methods should be requiered thanks to organic farming, which explains that using their method we could produce different types of energy sources like ethanol by producing crops. \r\n\r\n	This is long term process that means people have to get used to it, however is not going to be that difficult because the consumers are trying to change their habits of buying any product of the traditional farming methods thanks to their pollutants. Organic farming needs to be the solution for all the problems of the enviroment even for the farmers it will help both sides thanks to the reduce of use for any energy source such as oil and it will fight against any agricultural problem in this next years. Consuming organic products it will helps to create a new tendence and encourage the farmers to change their methods  ', '00:27:04', '3.0', '2.0', '1.0', '1.5', '2.0', '9.5', '3.0', '2.0', '1.5', '2.0', '2.0', '10.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '2.00', '1.25', '1.75', '2.00', '10.00', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.5', '2.0', '11.5', 0, ''),

Actually, this is an crucial question the world needs to know the benefits of organic farming and the disadvantages of conventional farming. The answer for this quistion would be yes. Securing the world is a one principle that the governments should try to improve by many ways one of them is explaining how important organic farming is. Orginic farming is a great alternative to conventional farming because it does not adversely affect the environment and develops the humans health. \r\n	First, the public must help each other to secure the the environment. Helping the environment is not very easy task that we have to lose sometimes some of our possessions to implement the right solution. Organic farming seems to be a smart solution that would have an efficient impact to the environment which needs to help. For example, if there is a farm and all of its products are organic and have natural fertilizers, the soli would not be destroyed by the fertilizer or any other things because it is naturally safe method. According to David Fisher organic agriculture does not include harmful chemical stuff and it helps the environment. As a result, organic farming is a real solution that can prevent dangerous effects. \r\n	In addition, eating healthy food is a worthwhile thing that the current generation should know. The humans need to save the natural sources that can provide the healthy food. The fact that the organic products have safe and valuable nutritious that are paramount. In the other hand, some researchers may say conventional foods have a great amount of nutritious and show conventional foods as a nice choice but that do not mean they are safe or do not have any dangerous effect on our lives. According to James Berlin people who like organic food do not agree about the results of the research. People like to have real foods and conventional foods are likely to be unreal food because of their chemical substances. Organic farming have a positive impact on our health. \r\n	In conclusion, conventional farming is not a great option that we should use. To have natural food and safe our sources the world needs to stop conventional farming and to use organic farming as an alternative that has paramount effects. Moreover, Conventional farming has inherant consequences that can destroy our health. In the other hand, Organic farming would prevent any catastrophic situation. I looked at the characteristics of organic farming which are help the enivronment and developing the humans health.', '00:02:40', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '1.5', '2.5', '11.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.0', '2.5', '3.0', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '2.25', '2.00', '2.00', '2.75', '12.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

Since the industrial revolution and the discovery of oil, many resources are being used in our favor in order to make life easier and to increase production. Among the areas where technology has been a changing factor, farming is known for shifting its old ways into new ones. With the access of oil, many fertilizers and pesticides are being used to eliminate plagues and increase the productivity of the soil. On the other hand, according to David Fisher, in his article "Organic Farming Versus Traditional Farming Methods" these changes brought by technology are responsible for many consequences to the environment and to our health. Regulations and policies are being used as a way to attack the problem, but the best solution offered is organic farming. Organic farming is a way of farming that consists in letting the nature go its own way without the use of artificial and toxic resources (Fisher). For this reason, organic farming must replace traditional farming in order to avoid damages to the environment, to mantain the production of healthy food and to save nonrenewable energy.\r\n	The environment is being negatively affected by many of the substances used by traditional farmers like pesticides. These substances contaminate the soil and affect the health of plants, animals and humans. Organic farming, offers a solution to this problem as explained by the author, avoiding the use of any artificial substance. With the organic farming methods, all of the damages to environment and to our health caused by pesticides, will considerably decrease.\r\n	Another important aspect being affected by the traditional farming methods, is the quality of the food. The nutritional value of many foods is decreasing because of the processes of the traditional farming. Artificial subtances are also causing the disappearence of natural flavors and a direct impact to our health. Organic farming centers its ways to mantain the food completely natural and healthy (Fisher). According to James Berlin, in is article "Stanford Scientists Cast Doubt on Advantages of Organic Meat and Produce" some of the benefits named before about organic farming are putted in doubt. Berlin argues that some organic foods and traditional foods are actually the same, explaing that organic food could be considered more expensive that its actual value. However, as it is also refered in berlin''s article, organic food is safer from pesticides residues which represents a thread to the human''s health. \r\n	The production of pesticides and fertilizers takes a considerable amount of energy to develop (fisher). An important quantity of oil which is a nonrenewable source of energy, is being used to create these subtances, energy that it should being used to other more productive porpuses instead of the creation of toxic subtances negative to our health and to the environment. Since organic farming does not use these kind of substances, a considerable amount of energy would be saved by avoiding the production of pesticides and fertilizers.\r\n	In conclusion organic farming is benefitial because it helps reduce many of the damages to the environment like the contamination of the soil, guarantees the safety of the food mantaining its nutricional value at it its best, and save an essential amount of nonrenewable energy. It is very important to consider that technology should not always be used to increase the velocity of factors, farming as one of those factors, should remain as natural as possible to preserve the order of nature and mantain a healthy relation between the product and the consumer.', '00:03:16', '4.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '15.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '4.0', '15.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.50', '2.75', '3.00', '2.25', '3.50', '15.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

There are many changes that have been taking to make the agriculture cover the needs of the people. Some of these changes included using more fertilizers and more pesticide to insure the amount of the crop (David Fisher). The farmer who are doing this based on some researches which states that the organic food is not more healthy than the other foods and there is not a serious danger in the food that come from the conventional farms (James Berlin), but is that right?\r\nThe organic farming is a wise alternative to conventional farming because the organic farming is more suitable for the environment and the health of the humans.\r\n	The many things that the conventional farming are using like pesticide and chemical fertilizers are causing big damages to the envirnmental system of our planet while the organic farmer try to use a different methods and materials that are frindly to the envirnment (Fisher). The pesticides will cause an air pullotion while the chemical fertilizers will cause contamination to the soil and to the surface water and the groundwater in the farms area. Furthermore, these chemical materials do not consider frindly to the environmental system because they can not be renewable while the farmer in the organic fames are tending to reduse as much as they can the using of the nonrenewable materials (Fisher). These material will form a real danger to the environmental system after a period of time because they are increasing day after day without any discharging. \r\n	The farmer in the arganic farms tend to make their productions rich with vitamines and nutrients by providing their lands and crop with natural materials (Fisher). In the other hand, the using of the chemical materilas in the other faming will make their fruits and vegetables contaminated with these materials. Even if the rates of these chemical material in these fruits and vegetables were withen the acceptable range like some researches had stated (Berlin),  but they may inform a serious threat to our health after aperiod of time when the their rates increase in our bodies. It is a common sense that the less chemical materials used in our food the more natural and valuable it will be.\r\n	All in all, It can be concluded that the organic farmin is a good option that could be taken instead of the conventional farming because of the good effects that the organic farmin have on the environment and the health of the humans due to the natural materials that the organic farming are using in their farms.', '00:09:20', '3.0', '3.0', '2.5', '2.5', '2.5', '13.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '14.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '3.00', '2.75', '2.75', '2.25', '13.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

People are now more aware of different farming methods and conscious about the way their food is cultivated. There are many difficulties found in agriculture, enviornmentalists, health-advocates and marketiers all try to alleviate the problems and handle the situation. They are attacking conventional farming methods and they have a solution: organic farming (Fisher 1). \r\n\r\nConventional farming of fruits and vegetables is vastly different than organic farming. It uses chemical fertilizers and pesticides and there has always been residue traces of these components (Fisher 1). Although the are harmful but when the percentage is very low or within the limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency, these traces of chemicals and pesticides do not harm humans when consumed (Berlin 1). I have been eating crops from conventional farming my whole life, and I have never been ill because of something I ate that was not organic. Organic farming on the other hand uses a different approach to cultivate crops. Instead of using chemical fertilizers and pesticides they synthesize it from oil. Their process does not affect the environment or harms it in anyways, as well as the consumers. Organic products hold a high nutrional value according to one article (Fisher 1). However, in another study by Standford scientists on the advantages of organic meat and produce, it has been concluded that there are no significant health advantages to organic meat and produce other than the obvious low levels of pesticides and fertilizers residue. This study was to bring awareness to consumers to make informed decisions (Berlin 1).\r\n\r\nPeople differ in so many ways. Sometimes people are governed to live a certain lifestyle based on their religious beleifs, moral standards, socioeconomic status, financial stability, educational level, or basically to follow a trend. Now, living on organic foods is highly expensive and if people can''t afford it then why is it being advertised? Conventional produce are very much less expensive than organic products and meat due the nature of its cultivation (Berlin 1). People do respect the efforts out in both farming methods but when comes down to money, people would most likely buy the cheaper prodcuts because they can purchase larger quantities, hence saving money at the same time. On the other hand, people who can afford an organic lifestyle will pay and not think twice about the money because who wouldn''t pay money to live a healhier life, knowing that your food has been brought up with care and percision and lesser residuals of chemicals and pesticides. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, organic farming is a wiser alternative to conventional farming because of the chemical residuals in the products. However, people will buy whatever products they want based on their priorities: healthy choice or financial stability. There is no nutritional value in the organic food that would convince me to buy it over conventional products, some products do taste better and I base my decisions on conveniality.

Because, all scientists says that chemical things are cause of cancer or another health problems. This question trying to find ansver which kind of farming methods useful for human and nature.There are two kind of farming methods such as ; organic and traditional. Organic farming does not use any chemical stuff which are pesticides and fertilizers, while traditional farming use(Fisher). People tend to consume organic farming''s things, as it seems to people just as health, safety and nutritional value.\r\n		The first reason to consume organic productions is health, because people care of their health more than the other affects in their lives. For example; cancer is a big problem in human life, and if a person who catch to bad or dangerous disease, the person might pay all of money for this disease. In traditional farming, Farmers use some pesticides and fertilizers for destroy the insects or bacteria whic are harmfull for their farm plants. All these kind of chemicals use from farmers for finding remedy to produce food storage life, and profitability(Fisher). On the other hand, they pollute our world, because they find and destroy insects or pests which are harmful for plants, farmers use posion for detroying insects, so who can say these posion does not effect people who use traditonal farming''s productions. Organic farming use no chemicals for plants, so that this methods more natural and expensive than traditional methods, but people who tend to use organic farming protect their world not only their healths.\r\n		In my childhood, I grew up in a small village of  Turkey. When I was 6 years old, I faced with a situation and I did not forget all my life. Our village teenagers killed 3 sneaks and they brought in the middle of village and they tried to scare people with them. After my mother had seen them,  She said them if they kept going to kill the sneaks our farm plants could be effected, because sneak eats rat or mouse, I understood life has a harmony and if a person touches very uncontrolled, the person can be change our lives uncoinciusly. '''' Organic agriculture aims to be in harmony, rather thanin conflict, with natural systems''''(Fisher).Traditional farming methods allow to use chemicals and some organization which name is the United Nations Food is controlling them and , but this circumstances  only valid in development countries and the rest of our world this is not controlled. They are not using these chemicals under the allowed safety limits(Berlin). When farmers use these chemicals uncoinciusly, they maybe put in danger our world and our healths.\r\n		The last but not least reason is nutritional value, because people bodies needs to put in their health cycle what they needs. On the contrary, their immun systems are getting alert. Stanford Scientists ask a question, '''' Does an organic strawberty contain more vitamin C than a conventional one?'''' (Berlin). First I try to find an answer this question; we use some synthetic chemicals for our plants and animals suh as: pesticides, hormones and additives(berlin). They provide to grow up all kind of plants and animals fastly. When we looked their shape, taste and smell, all these requirments are not excatly what they shoul be. And some scientists can say good things about convential one, but please remember, some scientists said very positive things about ciggarate, and nowadays people understand ciggarates effect on human bodies. The article says; '''' the researchers also foun no obvious health advantages to organic meats'''' (Berlin). I want to ask have some one cooked organic chicken in thir life? Answer is hiding in this question''s answer.\r\n		To sum up, there is a big conflict about organic and traditional farming between scientists, just as nuclear plant. Some scientist always support companies which provide money for them, while the others are not supporting. People should take a position with  the other scientists because of their health, safety and nutritional value. As far as  I know, organic agriculture is improving in our world, and all scientist and engineer understand natural things'' power in people lives.

People can buy stuff very anytime and anywhere; for instance, there are many kind of market that people can choose what they want. Some people perefer to buy convertional stuff becasue the price is available for them. In other hand, other people perfer to buy food in Whloe Food, which is a organic market, because they think the quality of there is better even thought the price is much expensive. Sometimes people will think about price before they buy what they want, organic food is still better than covertional food because of natural system.\r\n	Using chemical pesticides will make the land endanger, but if people choose organic farming, it will have no pulltion for the environment (Fisher). Sometimes farmer want their products look nice, so they will diceide to use artifical fertilizers. Although using it is helpful for their stuff, it is not good for the environment and people. For example, if their chemical pesticides is not enough to kill the animals, they will need to increase the number. if the they use too much it, it not only will distory environmet, but also will endanger people''s heath. Thus, it is better to use organic farming becasue some animals are helpful for agriculture, and it will not need to cosr extra money becasue it is from the nature.\r\n	The power of nature is very useful for people''s farming. People will not need to use toxic stuff to protect their plants because of the harnessed and develooed of nutural system. In the past, people do not need to use anything for they agriculture, and they still can eat. Although not using chemical pesticides will decrease their amount of food, it will have no pulltion in the environment. Everything has their relationship, so if people choose using chemical pesticides, they will break the balance of the nature, which is not good for their farming. Hence, using nature method  consider the pullution, but also their agriculture.\r\n	Although people have done a research which is about the nutritious of organic food is as same as convensation food (Berlin), people still need to remember conversation farming use more chmical pesticides, so it might  make people''s health be risk. People need to know using organic food is not only good for their environment, but also good for their health. they only need to pay a litte bit more money to buy orginic food, so it will be very worth if they diecide to use organic food.

Food in present days contain chemicals and are produced on a large scale with technology like pesticides and fertilizers. It is called the conventional farming method. Scientists have looked for many solutions to this problem and have found one solution that fits as an alternative to conventional farming, it is the organic farming method. Now while many think organic farming is not exactly better than the conventional farming methods, it is the best alternative producers and consumers have.\r\n\r\n	The different elements in food worries consumers more and more in every part of the world. Some foods nowadays are a little bit tasteless and others are just gross from being treated with chemcials. Organic farming, serving as a good alternative, can very well replace the conventional farming methods. Conventional farming methods use energy sources themselves instead of producing or tapping energy, while farmers who practice organic agriculture minimize the use of nonrenewable sources of energy (Fisher). That is a problem of conventional agriculture that affect the whole concept of food production. In addition, food industries focus on profits made from productions and do not focus instead on the consumer''s health which is not so much of a reliable choice.\r\n\r\n	Some scientists from Stanford University think that organic farming is "maybe not" a good alternative by saying that organic food is not more nutritious than the food produced in the "conventional way" and is more expensive (Berlin). While some chemical residues are present in some food, they are not harmfull and are under a certain limit of amount. They also focused on marketing by saying that in this method people are paying more for their food. This last statement only proves that there is more emphasis on the profits made on  production rather than the commodity or abundance of the consumers. Also, "Maybe not" is not a strong argument against organic farming. To make it simple, these arguments are not sufficient to change the minds of people prefering organic food over the "other ones".\r\n	\r\n	Organic farming may not be a perfect solution to the use of technology and chemicals in food production but it is the best alternative producers have over many others. Consumers are then faced with two options, the first is to chose organic farming in which the are willing to pay more for food that do not present chemicals and taste better or conventional farming in which farmers use chemicals and food can taste bad but is less expensive. The main problem now is how long farmers practicing the conventional way can use sources of energy to produce food. How long can they do it until there is no more? The more they use these sources, the less they are available and that can bring many other problems in the future. Organic farming is then the best option for agriculture as it does not present such consequences.', '00:06:57', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '3.0', '13.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '3.0', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '3.00', '2.00', '2.00', '3.00', '13.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, 'minimize the use of nonrenewable sources of energy'),

The people are prefer organic farming way, are being more intrested to their health and live style. But the other side of people have worried toward the profit margin, so they go with conventional farming. However, the benefits and the dameges are the judgement to decied which one is a good farming way for human and environment, where organic farming, depending on the reserachs, is showed the best way for us.\r\n	The organic farming has philosphy in agriculture method, which some people called "holistic", where knows as the entire of life, and mentions to netural meaning (Fisher). The organic agriculture goals to be fit this way with natural systems. The consept of it, to protect the crops from threat all insects and treat the diseases (Fisher).  In addition, this way is very helpful for our health, and keep us far a way from some disease or remain toxic inside our bodys from the preductions that use conventional way. For that reason, the organic farming does not use any chemical substances that could be harm human and environment (Fisher).\r\n	The new technology in farming cause some damages for the environment and people. In the poor countries which called the Third world, farmers concern just about their profit, and ignoring plocies (Fisher). As a result of that, people will contribute to destroy their environmnets, if they are still ignoring the risk from using their way. In addition, there are a lot of risk from use the chemical substances in farming.\r\n	On the other hand, there are researchers from Stanford think there is no diferent in the nutrition between The organic farming and conventional farming. They study the fruits and vegtables productions in both sides, then they said no more benefits than conventional, also they mention about there is no harm on human from conventional farming (Berlin). However, people who are prefer the oganic food still believe there are a lot of benefits, where they said the Stanford scientists failed to see the diferences between two types of food (Berlin). In fact, the opposite view is very weak to argue people who believe organic is better than other way.\r\n	In conclusion, The organic way is very credible for people, the benefits that reflict from organic production on our health is a larg thin can you notice among people.

Agriculture has faced several changes from its beganning until today. Agriculture methodes have been recently an argumantitive topic. Some people are in favor of conventional farmaing, where farmers use chemicals, pesticides, and hormons to control this process. This way''s advanteges are producing a cheap or not costly food and it minimize food''s infections to human (Berlin). Other people are supporting an organic way of farming, where they tend to make food in a natural way without useing chemicals. On this way people will reduce world''s polution and minimize humans contact to chemicals which is harmful to our human body and poeple whould propably be able to get all of vegetables or fruits nutrional''s value based on this method''s aim that will be safe and healthy (Fisher). Thus, nations should use organic farming to minimize our world contamination with chemicals substances and to use a method that aims to reach a suffecient food value which is healthy and safe.\r\n	First, in order to participate on keeping our world a safe living enviroment people should not use chemicals on their farming methods. Chemical pesticides and non-natural fertilizers will precipitate on vegetables or fruit, which will be ingested by our human body, which will evantually accumalte on our human body causing medical illnesses. Furthermore, farmin waste substances from conventional farming is causing a serious problem to our world as it is contaminate the soil (Fisher). In contrast, organic agricuture do not have this kind of problem.\r\n	Second, people should use a natural way which targets to give people the appropriate amount of food value or elements. Organic farming is seeking to provide people with vegetables and fruits that are healthy and safe for their human body through a sufficient nutritional value (Fisher). On this way should secure all human being which will be shown on its continueity.  This explain for us that this way should be used rather than the conventional way of farming.\r\n	To conclude, Organic methods of agriculture is the safest and heathiest way of food to be used for living as Organic farming does not need to use harful substances or chemicals and its porpose is to provide us with the sufficient food value rather than conventional methods which uses chemicals.', '00:40:08', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '11.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '3.0', '2.5', '12.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '2.00', '2.00', '2.50', '2.25', '11.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

What we eat shapes our way of living and says how our life looks like. Alos, our way of eating has a strong impcats on our health. Hence, people start thinking diffrentlly about food and how it farmed, what the procceses that food go throw, and what is the ways that farmers use. Recentlly, witht the new knolwedge, farmers are using new ways to grow up fruits and vegetables faster, and with the devolpment of technology farmers are more likely to produce more food to make more benfits. So, people are concernd about the way our food is farmed, and what are the methodes that have been used, this is one of the biggest issues in the United States. Many people beleive that organic farming is better than conventional farming, and this is true for two main reasons, organic farming is nutural, conventional farming is polluted. \r\n	Organic farming is the best way of making safe food, that will not affect our health negativlly becuas it is nutural and has not be expoesd to any harmful chemicals, and it also safe for the environment (Fisher). Organic farming is not using any of pesticides, insteed of thsat it uses nutral way to kill the insects. On the other hand, "Conventional fruties and vegetables did have more pesticide residue" (Berline). But he said that the amount of the pesticide is fallowing the safety limits. But how can we trust that the pesticide are not harmful! However, If we farm our food without using the new technology our any of the ways that some farmers use to increace thier prodacts, the food will be safer and healthier. When we compare our food and our way of living know and before, we will notice many diffrences in our health, that is due to farming. According to David Fisher, "Farming is a way of life, but organic agriculture is more than that: it is also a philosophy of life" (Fisher).    \r\n	Seconed point is conventional farming is polluted. Some farmers are using many ways to have bigger food with diffrent color, and some of them are only looking for thier income, and don''t care about the things they add to food unless thay can be strong in marketing (Fisher). How can we trust that these chemicals are not having any negative impacts in our health? Maybe it is the reason why people in the past are living longer that people today! In addition of that, conventional farming is using pesticides that might be harmful for the earth too! Or it might kills some ot the underground anmiles. Also, with these ways, food is loosing its value and some of the its vitamines. It is better to have food that is natureal than having food that has been added to many thing to it, to keep it for many months in your revegatouer without getting dameged! \r\n	Finally, people should not take this topic easily, and thay should call for action to have better food and more natural farming methods. farmers should reduce thier using of the chemicals that are not safe for our health. Because what we eat today will affects us tomorrow! And we should be careful about evrey thin that is happening around us. Farming is a huge majoer, and it can be safer and healther when we get rid of all the chemicals and pesticide, it should be more montierd. Organic farming is the safest farming way, and it is the only thing that can save the value of food and its benfiets, it is the poweful way to have heilther socities.

Usually, most companies are care about thier employees because one of the factors that may help them to have successful job is having good place. Many people have problems with thier bons if they still stand for many hours in thier work, therefore, now people have educated about how to keep on thier health from other factors  around them in workplce.  Moreover, the shap of chairs, great desks with lap and fittnec invironemnt in workplace are significant factors that might fit the shap of workers body with all diffrences job requiers ( Fisher ) In physical therapy the experts care about what people are doing and thier behaivores in thier job because all of these may effect on thier body such as sit on a chiar during thier work. For example, I''m a person who prefer to work while sitting on a comfortable chiar becuase I would like to have all the opertonity to have good place in my job or while I''m study. If I haven''t comfortable chiar to sit on it to do my job, I cant have amazing work in the end.

Care about workers emotions and feelings are good ways to push them to have sueccessful work. Acoording to Berlin in " Sitting In " he said, " Compared to the company''s previous Generation design, the ReGGeneration is lighter, more compact and less expensive. " So to choose a good chair for your workers is depend on the company which work to mke comfortable furnitures for them. The price maay not be important for huge companies thay have enough money to buy what make workers relax to help them during thier work. For instance, on of my uncile he is working in famouse company which is Aramco, in my country and he used to told my oldest brother to work thier, because they have such amazing office for each worker that reflx on thier personalty and thier job. They have different siz of chiars with desks and each new workers have to choose what is the comfortable and fit chair that make hime relx during his hard job.

Most people in our communities work in offices, spending all their days sitted on a chair and looking to screans and papers. Therefore, it is imperative that they do their work, in an emvironment, as confortable as possible, so that they will not have any health problems in the future. Hence, people have been looking for ways to make the office environment comfortable for those who work in it. After some reaserchs, to improve the office environment, people conclude that what people sit on, while working, is more important than how people sit.\r\n	Since almost everyone works sitted, it is easy to conclude that if we improve the chairs people are sitted on, in their offices, they will be more confortable while working and, consequentely, the office environment will improve. According to David Fisher, a way to improve the level of comfort of a chair is to make sure that they are soft and with few edges, and that they have the right size and hight (Fisher). All this chairs'' caracteristics have to change depending on the type of body they are made to.\r\n	Another change, that shows that what people sit on is fare more relevant than how they sit, is that people could start to invest in the "smart chairs". According to James Berlin, the Knoll ReGenaration chair, which was made with natural products, can be modified to suit the owner''s desires (Berlin). Therefore, they way you sit is not important because, no matter how you sit, you can allways change the chair in order to be confurtable. Moreovere, according to David Fisher, the concept of being confortable, while sitting, depends on each person and it is related with many feelings, such as relaxation, well-being, pleasure and many others (Fisher). Hence, the Knoll ReGenaration chair is perfect for the job it has. \r\n	Many people might say that how people sit is more important than the chair they are sitted on because they think that with the right postiure, the "''healthy'' silting" ( Fisher) posture, people can sit wherever they want to and still be confurtable and health. Although that is a very good argument, that "''healthy'' silting" posture is only good for a few hours (Fisher). Therefore, people can not star a whole day ofv work in that posture.\r\n	As we can see, the way people sit is not as important as what people are sitted on because it depends on each person and each chair.

Furthermore, there are many factors that detrmine the level of comfort while sitting.\r\n	First of all, it is more important to sit on a comfortable and convenient chair than just considering the way you sit yourself. Nevertheless, in the article " The Science of Sitting ", The author says that most of the sitting postures are comfortable most of the time but for a short period of time. In so, it is important to get a proper chair to make this period last for a longer time. A reliable, soft, and well-designed chair will help the body to relax. Eventually, the outcome is going to be positive for the employee, as well as their production and creativity rate while working. \r\n	Secondly, the ways employees and people sit could help to increase the comfort level, but still it is not as important as the chair that they are sitting on. In the same article, the auther claims that sitting or standing with a straight back is physically desirable and wanted for people. However, sitting on a comfortable chair, and suiting yourself on a chair are actually work together. There are some chairs with special characters so it leans back and forward or props you up while sitting. \r\n	In addition, in the article " Sitting In ", Berlin James recommended people to buy the best chair that they possible could afford. Berlin thinks that a good worthy chair is a great investment, especially for workers who need to be comfortable while sitting as much as possible, in order to get their work done efficiently. To prove if a chair is able to determine the how comfortable an employee is while working, Berlin had done an experment, he passed around a chair to his office-mates in different shapes and sizes. One of his office-mates found the chair comfortable as she did not have to keep her feet dangling as she did on every single chair she has ever used in that office. \r\n	Finally, what feels comfortable depends very much on the person himself, pressure control, and the passage of time.\r\nOur bodies will never be comfortable 100%, but we can raise the comfort by designing modern chairs that will help our bodies to relax and work efficiently.\r\n	', '00:30:15', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.0', '1.0', '1.5', '1.0', '3.0', '7.5', '1.0', '1.5', '2.0', '1.5', '2.0', '8.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.00', '1.25', '1.75', '1.25', '2.50', '7.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

For example, using a chair with rigid surface and with good back support is uncomfortable even if the person change his way in sitting.\r\n	All in all, having approprate chair and furniture are more important especially for those who spend lots of hours in working. Even though, it is true that thay they way in sitting effect in the body, but it is more important to have good and approprate chair because it is easliy to break the rule of sitting for a long time by sheduling the time during the work for doing some excerses or anything eles.  \r\n ', '00:05:08', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '2.0', '1.0', '1.0', '1.0', '1.0', '6.0', 0, ''),

Some people might feel more relaxed if they spend most of their time at work sitting, however, many studies show that spending all day sitting is tiring, (Berlin). So, some people might prefer to spend some of their time at work standing. There should be some materials that make you feel comfortable. What the chair is made of is important to make you feel good. However, I think that how to sit should be more important than what to sit on because sitting postions can determind your feelings and it ,also, has some healthy issues.\r\n	It is really important to sit in a right positions while working. The right position of sitting keep you feel feel in a good mood. For example, " comfot when sitting is associated with feelings or well-being, support, safty, pleasure, relaxation, rest warmth, softness and spaciousness",  David Fisher said. That indicates that the position while sitting can affect the person. In addition, it is nesscery to sit on chair that offers you many possible kinds of positions because way of sitting is different from one to other. For example, the chairs should allow the students or workers to adjust their postions such as hight and backrest position, (Fisher). consequently, they will be able to change their between different times.\r\n	Moreover, how to sit is important for our health. Our bodies should always be straight while standing or sitting. The scientist Staffel''s theories of healthy sitting, which was accepted by many doctors and people, recommended that head, neck, trunk and back should be straight, (Fisher). It is essentail to keep these parts of our bodies straight because the extended time of sitting can lead to poor blood circulation, (Fisher). Furthermore, " motion change, variation, and adjustment to fit the individual are central to a person''s wellbeing while sitting", ( Fisher). Moving while sitting for extended period is helpful for our bodies to refersh and be ready to carry on working again.\r\n	 To sum up, to be comfortable while working or studying, we have to have the proper furnitures. One these furnituers is chair. However, it is not about the chaors themselves, it is about how to sit on the chairs because we can feel more comfortable due to the positions of sitting, and the position of sitting is related to some health issues.

Many companies and institutions spent a lot of money trying to establish the best healthiest working enviroment. However, a huge question mark raised on which is more convenient for workers to be able to work effeciently; The way of sitting on the office chair''s, or the chair itself. Some people are thinking since workers spend most of their work sitting on chair, they should buy the most comfortable chair. Even if it was expensive, as this chair would be their best investment (Berlin). However, a normal human body is adaptive to many sitting or standing position, and it is a physicians recommendation to change the sitting poisture frequently (Fisher).\r\n	First, human body is able to adapt on several sitting or standing poistures for a while (Fisher). Since the begining of human race people were adapted on several enviroments. They got used to live on forest, north or south pole, or mountains. They never complain about their sitting or standing position as they always find a way to adapt. Many of todays inventions were done, no one of those scientist ever compalin about his chair. Moreover, not any one could be able to afford expensive chairs to find the apropriate postions. People were adapted to do so many things. This is why where people sit on while working is not a big deal.\r\n	Second, people may need to get to change their position frequently. Because humans need to avoid certain medical conditions, as low blood flow to some organs or edemia based on physicians recommendations (Fisher). For instance, if someone was standing for many hours, this could lead to lower body edemia, which is due to boold congestion. This is why the way of sitting plays a major role on human body more than the sitting chairs.\r\n	Finally, human body is able to adapt on many things. It does not matter on where they sit to do their work. The way of sitting plays a major role on humans bodies health, which is the major concern "human health".

Most of the people usually work sitting on a chair and they want it to be confortable, so they can sit in the way they want. Everybudy wants to feel good in their jobs and the best way is having a good place to sit. Therfore, people who work should conssider more important in what they sit rather than in how they sit. So, if the chair is good workers will be feel confortable and it helps their helath. \r\n\r\n	Today people just want confort were ever they go, and the office is not the exception. when people work they are always under presure and have stress problemes.

Many people  dedicate their lives to help other peoples problems. One of the problems that people have today is that they have several back problems caused by the way they sit and also the chairs where they sit on.

However, a big debate is happening about what is the main reason of comfortable offices, many people think that the way of sitting makes you more comfortable. Scientists are studying the best way to comfort your body to the chair, and companies are making new chairs.\r\n             There are many benefits of having a chair in your office, like, staying healthy, comforted, and keeps you more efficient. According to David Fisher in the article "The Science of Sitting"; In 1884, Staffel, the scientist who published theories about healthy posture of sitting, and his theories stayed for a very long time, and it was accepted by almost everyone, but they were very difficult, because they require sitting in the same way for most of the time, which is quite  uncomfortable for the body that need to move. Nevertheless, not moving for long times cause problems like, poor blood circulation, and fluid build-up in the lower legs. Later other scientists said that sitting comfortably depends on the person''s body-type, physical appearance, and his activities. And finally, in 1997, Helander and Zhang, the researchers who said that comfort and discomfort are two different scales. Comfort is the scale where you fell well-being, saftey, pleasure, and other postive feelings. On the other hand, discomfort is the scale of the negative feelings like feeling stiff, in pain, or restless. After that, both researchers tried to define the rank of an uncomfortable cair''s comfortablity from one to nine, but they found out that it''s hard to rank the comfortability of the uncomfortable chair, because it gave them different feelings.\r\n            "Sitting in" is one of James Berlin''s articles that says (What you are sitting on, is important.). Berlin''s theory is called "The Knoll ReGeneration" wich is about meshback desk chairsd. He says in his article that Knoll have made a new chair that is lighter, less expansive, and more comfortable than the ones before. The design of the structure is very minimal, the company used the least amount of plastic that they can , and around 50% of the chairs are made of recycled material. What is  nice about the ReGeneration is that it is too easy to build it up and adjust it. \r\n          In a combination of both articles, it is obvious that what you are sitting on is more important than how you sit on it, because if what you are sit on is comfortable, then, defenatly your way of sitting will be comfortable too. Another thing that, what you sit on can is modern you can control your way of sitting and allow your back muscles to be relaxed. However, if what you sit on is less important to you than the way of sitting, then, if just a spring was damaged you will be uncomforted with the chair even if you tried in the most comfortable way that you can.\r\n        In conclusion, to stay straigh back in a comfortable way can make the chair comfortable for a period of time, but not for a long time, and also when when you sit  straight back on a comfortable chair for a long time might make you feel uncomfortable, but just by changing your posture on comfortable way can make comforted again.

This behavior lead to some questions, regarding it is affect in our health. However, right now there are companies try to design a very comfortable and flexable chairs that overcome all these problems for sitting for a long time. This also lead for other questions, what is more important: How the person sit or what the person sitting on? In this article will shows some evidence, recomendation and the slove of this problem.\r\n	In the modren life people spend most of their time sitting, in work, at home, long road trips and many situations.

However there is a company designed a desk chair that sutable and adjustable for any person, whatever how tall the person or weight is. This desk chairs have a great support for our body and it it reduce the stifness of muscles due to sitting for a long time(Berlin). Despite the fact how great is this idea, it have a draw back becuase it is price, not any person can affored this chairs, also not any company can bring this chairs to their workers. Aslo it is recommended shift between standing and sitting (Berlin).\r\n	There are a lot of studies about best body postures during sitting. The scientis Staffel says the best body postures is the stright posture during sitting, it is the same when the person standing erect (Fisher). This position during sitting anyone can do it in any chairs. In addition, it not need anymoney to do this position, also it is not requered a lot of skills to learn how to sit, it is not a rocket science, any person can do it.  Furthermore, human body is amazing it can adapt during sitting. To prove this there a study about comfort and discomfort by the researchers Helander and Zhang. The result shows the human body is adaptive during sitting and it is hard to rate the comfort and the discomfort to design a very comfortable chairs (Fisher). These type of studies also related to the person physical status, if the person any history of back injury and pain (Fisher).\r\n	In short, there are a lot of studies to overcome health problem that related to sitting for a long time, even there companies try to design a very comfortable chairs to overcome this problem .

For this reason, we have implemented new tools and accesories in most of work and study fields. As an example, the chairs invention has changed the human life style at work since a long time ago, promoting a better efficiency and good health during long hours of work. However, concepts like discomfort or comfort, which are the most important veredict for workers, are clearly subjective and could depends on ''how we sit'' and ''what we sit on''. That''s why we cannot reduce the question in those two ways as they are differents, because these two issues complement each other, and could be part of a modern solution. Nonetheless, is clear that ''how we sit'' is a precendent of the other, and this first issue could determine the answer of the second one, being more important.\r\n	Following the point, it should be clear that the final veredict, which determine the best solution to improve our quality of work conditions, is clearly subjective. While we can find some people who are able to get better results when they work standing, we also will find people who need to remain sitted all the day and concentrate in what they are doing. Nevertheless, we should clarify that human body is adapted to be changing all the time and we can not remain in the same position, neither stading still nor sitting still (Fisher). A fact that vary even more their conclusion, creating an answer which depends on individual habits, work environment, hours of work, and clearly the specific task that we want to finish. Thereby, chairs companies are directly dependents of studies about ''how people sit'' and which are their work habits based on their veredicts, in the way to create the best solution for every work field. \r\n	While we accept that our relationship with our chairs could be more intimate than we can consider them to be, given that we spend a great part of the day sitted on them (Berlin); we must invest in a good chair that describe precisely our comfort standards and help us to be better at work. Adjustment, flexibility, support, balance, structural design and more, could be the best features for a good chair that promote a healthy posture during the day. However, as a subjective decision, we cannot determine the ideal chair and we should be aware of what we need to improve our work conditions. And only when we know what everyone needs, and all of these factors "fit" the person, we will be able to work in comfort (Fisher).\r\n	Hence, as a conclusion, I consider that ''how we sit'' is the most important answer to let the companies work for their customers. In spite of that, we should not paint a barrier between ''how we sit'' and ''what we sit on'', because those are factors that complement the best solution. As we cannot create a chair dismissing people opinions, we also could not give an opinion if we haven''t try the current inventions and we don''t know what we need. That''s why is important to keep these answers together, but at the same time, we need to give a priority to how people sit to feel comfortable, and only thereby, we will fulfill their expectatives.\r\n	\r\n	\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	\r\n\r\n', '00:01:02', '2.5', '2.5', '2.0', '2.0', '3.0', '12.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.5', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '15.5', '3.00', '2.75', '2.50', '2.50', '3.00', '13.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

It has become much more important than ever and the human cannot complete the entire life without a good quality health particularly when they work at office for many hours.In modren life, there are a large number of problems of health that the employeers are suffering during their times of work at office especially when they are sitting on chair. Nowadays, some people ask question about this issue, does the chair consider the main reason of  these problems? Or, does the way of sitting on chair consider the essential reason of these problems? I believe that the employeers should have a lot of comfortable chairs while they work for many hours for tow reasons like: health and stability.\r\n	First of all, Unfortunately, studies have shown that sitting for many hours at office may cause a lot of healthy problems. According to Devid fisher, there are a large number of bones problems like neck, head and back pain, and that because of the posture of body when it is sitting on uncomfortable chairs. As he mention that one of the most important factors of comfortable sitting is the furniture or likely the chair. However. James Berlin argue that he says when he is sitting on rigid chair, he is always focsing on his work. Comfortable chair maybe cause to sleep the employeers during time of work. \r\nBesides, as soon as you know the weeknesses of your health during timework, you can choose the appropriate method to eliminate on healthy problems.\r\n	One of the reason why the employeers should sit on comfortable chair is that the employeers need to be stabilised. Even though the stability of body affects in health in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Some employeers believe that uncomfortable chair make their work very difficult. Stability means the comfort. As Devid said that the chair should undergo for many requierment, some of which the chair should has good design and it does not be very big or too small. However, James said the opposite that the chair should have a good the precentage of plastic to support his back.Also, the stability will help the employeers to work hard and hones  \r\n	To sum up, despite the fact that sitting on comfortable chair has few disadvantages and drawbacks nevertheless it is my opinion the advantages and benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In additin, government and higher authorities should take the responsibility to force the companies to tackle the healthy problems to make their employeers living in a good quality life by providing comfortable chairs.

Physically people like to move their body in order to transfer the blood to the whole body. "Scientist suggest that there is one way to help human to sit for a long time, sitting upright". Daivid Fisher said, who is behavioral studies reader in Oxford university. We should spend our our money as much as we afford because that is on of the fundamental thing in our daily life. In my opinion to increase the period of time of being sitting is changing the furniture,and develop the qualites of chairs.\r\n	First of all, building our furniture is must be appropriate for our body in order to abapt with it easily."I recommended stright posture of the trunk, neck, and head, similar to the desired back posture when when standing erect" Staffel cliams (Science of Sitting). The majority of people comfort with this concept which is standing and sitting with a stright back. Of course we will feel beter while we sit in the flexible chair which is not has any slouch, and lean. Therefore, people can endure to sit more than they do with old postures. For instance, based on James Berline, once time he tried to test the chair''s range of adjustment, he put them around the office of various shapes and sizes. Indeed, he is taller than the workers but they also find comfortable when they sit in them (Sitting In). Moreover, we will feel safety, relaxition, with these sophisticated shapes, posture, and size of chair''s. \r\n	Secondly,the modren design models for furniture need high qualities in order to make their materials more comfortable. It will be better for us if we could afford to buy great furniture such as healthy chair. "A good chair os a sound investment, and logic dictates you should buy the best chair you can afford" Berlin said. Furthermore, Here are some materials which make the furniture usefull, cotton,aluminum, and plastic. These things will keep your back muscles relaxed and flexible. According to Knoll, half of these materials are made by recycled, 48 percent if you choose the aluminum and 44 percent if you choose the plastic. Exploiting these stuff is really helpful to make some basic furniture in our life. We could say a chair is such a friend that we can not live without. If we imagine our life wthout it, it will be invitable to face some obstacles like working or doing something in the computer.\r\n	To sum up, in this era developing the furniture is one of the important thing that we require in our life.People now are busy so they need to spend a long period of time to sit in the chair in order to finish their works as soon as possible.

Is it real or a marketing myth? Since the office work environment has had several changes during the last century  this workplace issue has become more and more big and controversial every year, given that employees have to work for many hours per day--- either sitting or standing (Fisher). Hereby, a lot of scientists and researchers have anounced many different theories about what is the better sitting posture, some of them assert that a straight position while working is the best posture and some others thatthe comfort vary depend of each person. Hence, each employee has to find the posture that fit better with them and that would be better for them health, and also, to develop a good work environment to make the work-hours more enjoyable and less stressful.\r\n	Despite the fact that our most communly posture while we are erect is an straight position of the back neck and head, that does not mean that this one is the best posture while we are sitting, as well, according to David Fisher in his article " The Science of Stting." Furthermore, this erect position of the body during the whole work-time has been found by many research uncomfortable and speccially dangerous to the cardiobascular system and tha coul bring problems to it, as such aslow blood preassure, due to the structure of the human body is used to continous changes in its position, all day long (Fisher). Additonally, the human body cannot stay nither standing or sitting for a prolonged period of time, consequence of the health problems tha it brings explained above. Hence, some research has found that the proper percent between sitting and standing position at work should be 70% and 30% respectively (berlin).\r\n	Alternatively, a proper postion and ostenly move around the office place is not the only way to make the work-time more enjoyable and less stressful. According to Fisher another aspect that affects employees health and peroformance at work is the preassure to accomplish the task and the environment that they and the other employees generate at the office work place.

On the other hand, these studies have found that the best way to keep your body health high is to create a good work environment, enjoying what you are doing, and especially moving all around your workplace and changing your posture oftenly.

There are many developements that happened during more than 100 years in the life particularly in the offices for their desks and the attachements. therefore, A lot of studies are done in this field in order to get an ideal comfort to people who work in different offices especially the clercks. Finding successful solutions to this problem will give more acceptance fo the people, then, it will be more comfortable, more healthy, and more benifial.\r\n	Team of scientists and researchers ensure that the situations that are taken by employees on their seats, affect on their health through pains of the back and disturbtion of the blood circulation ( Fisher). In order to make the best comfortable, there are many suggestions an recommendations that are related to this problem. For example, the researcher Helander and Zhang in their study about the chair attribute the pains of the backs and the legs for the employees to the shapes and qualities of chairs that heraby cuase discomfortable (Fisher). This means, the employees sould take suitable positions in their sitting on the chairs.\r\n	Another view says there are many changes that happened during many decades in industry of the furnuture especially the chairs and the seats. These achievements make a modern live more progrissive compared to the previous time for relating with relaxtion and health. There are many types of seats and cairs according to the material that made of. Besides wood chair, there are plastic, thermplastic, and recycled chairs and seats. Moreover, there are two types of the chairs; fixed and moved, the moved chair or seats become their role more active in the live, where from movement parts of the chair by several levers, the employee can make his body with more comfortable and healthy ( Berlin).\r\n	There are two views that are different in this problem depending on the sitting situation or what ii sit on. I preffer the opinion that says that people must select a suitable chair or seat which adaptes with everyone''s situation. Then, plenty of people do not suffer of harms or pains in their bodies. \r\n	In conclusion, many situations that are related with people who suffer from pains in their bodies because of the sitting on chairs or seats for long periods especially the employees who work in different offices.

Generally speaking, they spend much of their days sitting on the chair to work. Nowadays, almost all business people work sitting on chairs. Then, it is important how comfortable the chair you sit on is, not only because you spend so many hours on that chair, but also because using a bad chair can cause health problems (Fisher). There are many people thinking about how we can sit down comfortably, and some people say that how you sit down on the chair or your posture is a key. However, I strongly believe that what you sit on is much more important than that. There are two reasons I think this way; body''s adaptiveness, and makers'' development.\r\n       First, before talking about adaptiveness, you should know how we feel comfortable. The feeling of discomfort is related to chairs in wrong sizes or unpleasant materials, but it does not mean that if you remove these factor, it can be comfortable. According to Fisher, the feeling of comfort includes the ideas of well being, support, safety, and so on, but it generally depends on the person. The research carried out by Helander and Zhang revealed that we can easily tell whether the chair is comfortable or not, in constrast it is difficut to measure its discomfort. They concluded that is because the body has an amainzing ability to adapt. Our bodies can move and change the posture freely, so you can sit on any kind of chair unless that chair is extremely bad. However, you do not feel comfortable even if you just handle the chair. In order to feel good, you need the appropriate chair for yourself. In this sense, how you sit on is not so important, and whether you can sit comfortably is determined by what chair you choose. This is why I think the chair itself is important.\r\n     Secondly, furniture makers help us to choose the right one to sit. The development on the human body and engineering enables makers to produce much more better products than before. Berlin says in his article that his favorite chair is versatile and comfrotable, and even manages uncomfortable positions of people sitting on it, even it is less expensive than its previous model. In addition, this chair has wide range of adjustment, so you can change its height or slope as you like. This feature allows it to go with many people. This is only one example, but this means you can purchase good chairs easily these days, and to buy the right chair is much more easier than to fix your bad posture. This is also why I think it is better to consider what chair you choose.\r\n     In conclusion, I feel that you should choose appropriate chairs rather than reconsider your posture for two reason. First, our bodies can move flexibly and fit almost all furnitures, but it does not mean you feel comfortable on that chair. You still need the one that you prefer if you want to be comfortable. Secondly, these days makers produce comfortable and flexible products, so you can easily choose the one that go with you.\r\n ', '00:00:00', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '3.0', '14.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.5', '3.0', '3.0', '15.5', '3.00', '3.00', '3.25', '2.50', '3.00', '14.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

In the article "Sitting In" the author explains that what people sit on is is important and he provids the reason with many examples(Berlin,James). The materials or the products of what people sit on is more essencial than the way of how they sit because the chairs or the products for sitting are disgined to be comfortable for sitting, convienent for everybody, and they are sheap in price in terms of the materials ithey made from.\r\n	The most importantis that the chairs are desgined to be comfortable to sit on. The chairs with excellent materials made to be ready to sit on.For example, the designing of that chairs are easily to be fixed in the way that is comfortable for the worker,in deed, the chairs made of equipment that support the body position, to keep the back of our body  in stright and suitable for our spinal cord to be in appropriate postion as what the doctor recommended (Berlin). That''s mean, we do not have to care about how we sit on due to these chairs are already made of materials that make us sit in healthy way. On the other hands, some people think that the way of the sitting on the chairs is more important than what people sit on, what ever the materials are made of, to clarify that if we sit with postion that we feel is comfortable to our back on chair made of wood, our body can not handel it and we will not able to sit on it for long time.So we should take care of the materials instead of the how we sit.\r\n	Second, the chairs with good materials are suitable for everyone to be used. The charis are easily to adujest to differnt kinds of people.To illustrate, when Berlin in his copmany let his friend to try the chair with good materials, his friend who is shorter that him, was able to set the chair with the way that he feels comfprtable with (Berlin).This explain to us that the chairs materials are important because everybody can set it with the way that is appropriate for his or her  body to be heathy and not enjured his or her. In the opposite side,when people sit on chair made of wood, it will be not easily to adujst in way that is good for us because it is rigid and not easily to set it the way we want.\r\n	Finally, the materials that make the chair is comfortable are priceless. Although the materials are comfortable,they are with low price. To demonstrate, The compamies make comfortable chairs with materials that are from recycling products and with materials are not heavy which make the price of these comfortable chairs not high (Berlin).That clarify for us why those chairs are not expensive even though they are convienent for us. Nevertheless, if we buy a chair that made of fancy or rare wood it will be with very high price and we will not sit in appropriate way. Therefore,we do not need to buy chair with very expensive materials and matter about how we sit because there are charis with low price and they are convinent to sit on them.\r\n 	To sum up, people who required from their work to sit hours in the disk office  it is crucial for them to care about what equipment they sit on beacuse these chair pruducts are made to be good and suitable to sitting on, easily to be used by everybody and are not expensive. We can save our money and buy chairs with excellent materials and sit the way  we want because they allready desined for us to be comfortable.', '00:02:48', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '11.0', '3.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '2.0', '11.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '2.00', '2.00', '2.00', '2.00', '11.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, '');

Sitting all day on a desk trying to finish work on an uncomfortable chair is exhausting; or is it the manner we are sitting that is uncomfortable? How we sit and what we sit on while working are very important factors in measuring comfort, however, what we sit on certainly has more effect on our comfort and efficiency while working. \r\n\r\n	There has been a wide agreement on the famous sitting posture: straight back, neck, head and trunk. It is the posture they promote in schools, stress on socially for being appropriate, and forced in the military. However, sitting in a straight posture for a long time is tiring, exhausting, and uncomfortable, especially if the chair does not allow you to adjust and maneuvor a little. Sitting for long hours could lead to health problems such as insufficeint blood circulation, neck and spine issues and lower legs fluid build-up (Fisher 1). \r\n\r\n	Helander and Zhang elaborated on the notion of comfort and discomfort; where they were not on the same scale but on two separate scales. Discomfort was mainly revolved around the shape, size, and material of the chair. While comfort was associated with feelings, relaxtion, spaciousness and well-being (Fisher 1). Surprisingly, humans are adaptable to various things in life, including chairs. Workers can adjust to different types of chairs to make them sit and work comfortably, but there are many factors that could lead them to feeling annoyed or uncomfortable such as the ambiance, the space, the noise level and instead blame the chair''s shape for it. Hence, it is important that the chairs we sit on are carefully designed to allow us to sit in different position and to be able to sit on them for long periods of time while avoiding the health damages.\r\n\r\n	The Knoll ReGeneration is one of the top desk chairs available in the market , with it''s sleek design, comfortable sitting cushion, arms or no arms option, and adjustable hight, angle and inclination levers. As told by one user, it supports different positions, she has an uncomfortable position, slouching frequently, leaning, and she''s also off-balance sometimes (Berlin 1). This chair is well thought of, it''s mainly produced from recycled materials, light and compact and to some extent affordable. Hence, comfort should be priceless. \r\n\r\n	Working as a speech therapist with a varied population: children, young adults, adults, and seniors with different disorders and disabilities. Each of them require a different seating plan that I prepare for in advance. The clinic provided us with different types of chairs for each and every possible client so that when they are comfortable, they could work and cooperate efficeintly. The chairs were not only for clients, but for clinicians as well. The clients need to be seated mainly, while clincians need to be able to move aroudn swiftly. It was imprtant that we were comfortable doing our job. \r\n\r\n	In conclusion, comfort is not something you can find in a chair, however, working on a comfrtable chair could make the experience as a whole a lot better. The type of chairs we sit on are important because it would promote a healthy sitting posture, as well as provide us with ability to move, adjust, and adapt while avoiding the health hazards.', '01:15:29', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '2.0', '4.0', '15.0', '3.0', '2.5', '3.0', '2.0', '4.0', '14.5', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.00', '2.75', '3.00', '2.00', '4.00', '14.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

They have to work for hours also must of their time working is sitting in a chair for several hours. However, there is multiple studies that argue the  issue of working many hours at the officce are harmfull thanks to the several hours sitting in their office chairs. James Berlin said "A good chair is a sound investment." the solution for him is buying a expesnive chair and that may resolve your back problems. Neither the cost of the chair or the design of it will changes anything in your back problems, there are two solutions, which are the straight posture of your body while you sit and the feeling of comfort while your work. The following statements are going to show you why these are so important. First, Having a straight posture prevents back illness; second, feeling comfort is essencial in your office.\r\n	The theory of "Healthy sitting"  the theory that was aproved by doctors, teachers, and parents is important for anyone who work in a office because it prevents you for having a bad posture and back problems. Eventhough this theory helps any worker in a office sitting for several hours straight back is never going to be comfortable because our body needs move to avoid any other problems such as bad blood circulation (Fisher, David.) Is a common knowledge that sitting for many hours in a office is not something that everybody wants to do, but they have to do it. Adapting the design of the chairs could be a solution for some poeple, but not always it works in that way posture still a important toll that you could use during your work be wize and use it.\r\n	Is important to feel excellent where you work. Because you are going to spend multiple years working, if you never find the feeling of comfort where you work it may be anoying for you to work there. However, feeling comfort depends in many details David Fisher explain that feeling comfort while you sit depends in many other factors it could be the excellent feeling of your chair, but most important is the environment and how your day go during you work. On the other hand the meaning of comfort is really close to the meaning of discomfort which is not feeling ok wherever you are. You must to find the comfort in your work place it will help you with your task at work and deal with any other problem that you may face at work.\r\n	In a sum working in a office may be anoying  for many people and sitting in a chair for several hours without the right posture it will be harmfull for your future.

People should sit when they are working in offices because they will be most comfortable, and they will produce effictively. On top of that, they should chose chairs that fit to their body appropriately.\r\n                 First and formost, sitting in chairs make the worker relaxed in his or her work . It makes the worker feel comfortable about what he or she are doing because its eliminate the stress, and the anxiety from the worker. Furthermore, David Fisher states in his article "The Science of Sitting." article that: "Sitting is a much less tiring posture than standing,". Therefore, sitting protect some of the worker power so they can produce more because "it requires fewer muscles to be contracted,"(Fisher).\r\n               The second reason why people should sit more than they stand while they are working is because it makes them produce affectively. To illustrate, People who sit on chair while they work are organized because their minds are focused on what they are produced. So that give them huge opportunity to be affective in their field.In addition, sitting makes the employees carness about their job duties. Moreover, modren offices nowadays are designed to fit the "body position" (Fisher). Because of that, most of the world''s ministries, and companies buildings depand on the sitting system to their emoployees.\r\n                However, having a good chair to the sitting-worker in his and her office is very important. The reason why employee''s should pick up the appropriate chair, and desk that fit to their bodies is to avoid having muscles and bones problems. Because of that, employee should chose the chair that qualified to his/her size and body condition. In "Sitting In" article, James Berlin recommends "the Knoll ReGeneration." which is a desk chair product that provide many unique features to the sitting-workers.

It is important to sit in a comfortable chair. People are not the same and they have diffrint needs. Therfore, what may be comfortable to one of them may not be the same for the others. In addition, chairs may be comfortable for kind of work but uncomfortable for others. For example the doctors chair are diffrent that the office chair. Also, how long does the employee will stay sitting. When workers fell comfort they can be effective and succissful.  Heland and Zhang made a study for chair comfort and discomfort in 1997. They foud that "it difficult to rank the chair by attributes of discomfort because the body is surprising adaptive" (Fisher). That show that people need time to know if the chair is comfort or not for them. \r\n	Chair in offices must have the ability to be adjusment. In the artical "Rhe Scince of Sitting", by David Fisher, he points out that in the past peple used to think they should sit in straight back position for their health, but this is not true. He says that human body have to move and not stay still for a long time. Therefore, chairs should have the ability to adjust to meet the employees need, so they can change their position from time to time. In addition, usually in office many employees use the same chair. "Workers should be able to make adjustment to seat height and angle, backtest position, and other key design features of their chairs" (Fisher). For that reason, employees should adjust the chair to fit thier need easly. \r\n	Chairs are the same as any other furnature that should not affect the environment badly. James Berlin points out in "Sitting In" his own experince with Knoll ReGeneration chair. He says many importent quaities that his chair has such as the price, the ability to adjustment, and the weight, but I think the most imprasive thing is that about hafe of that chair is made from recycled materals (Berlin). This is an importent thing to know about the chair you would like to buy because this kind of chairs would help us save the enviorment.

Sitting comfortable depends on the chairs people sit on and on the way they sit. Sitting properly for long periods of time, especialy while working, is essential in order to feel the comfort and prevent hurting your back or body. It is important the way you sit while working despite what you sit on or what your chair made from due to the health facts about it and the feel of comfort.\r\n	First, you can prevent back problems when you sit in a good way. People are smart enough to avoid buying chairs which are uncomfortable to sit on. Even if your chair made from a good material, it is vital to know how to sit properly as what David Fisher informed in his article, "The Science of Sitting", that when you sit inproperly for a long time it affects your body in a bad way as causing problems in legs and lacking blood circulation. Even if you feel good while sitting it does not appear imediately, the bad effects will become clear after long time of making the bad habit while sitting. Many people believe that they can sit in a way that makes them feel well but it doesn''t last long (Fisher). That shows, in spite of the chair material, it is vital for each individual to sit properly with a straight back to not put pressure on one side.\r\n	Second, you can feel more comfortable depending on how you sit. Each person has his own prespictive on how they feel comfortable while sitting. But he is not able to recognize what the consequenses after that over the time. Berlin James demonstrates in his article, "Sitting In", a good chair can help when sitting on it in any way, he tried to sit on one of those good chairs and he felt amused how it effective is it. Although good chairs may help when you sit on in any position, it is well known that the body takes its shape depending on how it use to be and the problems will appear in the long term. Even though, when you lean yourself forward whilr sitting your back start to hurt and you need to stretch or relax it. However, this will leads you to back problems when it is made consistently.\r\n	To sum up, the need of a good chair while working is not a big deal.

Perhaps the answer to this question is depends on what type of life or what type of job people have. For example, people can be office workers, teachers, housekeepers, lawyers, doctors but all of them have something in common: in any time of their lives, they will suffer of back pain because of a bad posture. Since the development of the industry and technology, company''s owners requiere that their employees achieves daily goals based on productivity and performance. The most part of the time, the employees are siiting on their chairs during the labor. Even in their houses, after work, parents could stay sitting on the sofa and watching T.V. and young people spend their time playing video games laying on the coach or sitting on the floor. This type of behavior provokes, nowadays that so many patients will be attended by special doctors to relieve their back pain. That means a lot money invested in medical health care to cope with this problem. People should care about how they sit instead of focusing only in what they sit on while they are working because a bad posture problem affects their health, the social and laboral relationships and impacts their economy.\r\n	Some people state that the posture is only matters if it affects people during the time they are working. Many workers spend more than forthy five hours per week in their jobs, most of time doing sitting tasks.Therefore, it is important to choose a good office chair to avoid back problem in their future. At the end, it is valuable the "what" instead of the "how". According to James Berlin is important the material of what the chair is made from and he mentioned that the qualities of a good office chair are comfortable, adjustable and adaptable of any kind of human body. Those arguments are valid but refutable. I can agree to some to extent because in first instance, it is important to choose a good chair not only for work, but also to sit in the house, in the cinema, in the church, in the airplane, etc and the most important thing is to know how we can sit on those chairs without taking into account what is the material or what are the properties of them. Sometimes, when people sit on chairs is because they are tired and they need some time to recover their strenght. Being a little strict on the Berlin''s argument, the owners should provide comfortable chairs to their workers and do not allow that employees buy them. Special office chairs costs between $540 to $676 (Berlin), maybe these chairs are not affordable for workers based on their incomes.\r\n	First and foremost, people should focus on how their posture are because affect their health. It is not new that people are worried about the consequences of bad posture. An important study was publised in 1884 by the scientist Staffel. He stated theories about "healthy" postures that included specific ways to keep the trunk, the neck and the head while people are sitting on their seats (qtd. in Fisher). However, having a good posture does not means that people have to maintain the same position all the time or during long terms. Some studies have revealed that people who try to put their back in a straight postition for long time, they feel uncomfortable and leads to many problems, for example: circulation problems especially in legs (Fisher). To avoid health problems due to bad posture, people need to understand their body''s necessities for adapting them to the chair''s realities.\r\n	Second, it is necessary that people be aware on how they sit on because this will affect their social and laboral relationship and productivity. If people are uncomfortable or sick, they do not produce well-done job and their relationships between co-workers and their family could be deterioraded. It is usual to have relatives of work''s partners that have bad mood due they are not happy with their chair or because they have back pain. An interesting study of chairs was released in 1997 by researchers Helander and Zhang. They studied the concepts of "comfort" and "discomfort". They created non parallel scale to describe these terms based on feelings that people have during the time they were sitting on (qtd. in Fisher). The results of this study are so remarkable because the researchers found a wide variety of answers among the participants. The most information people had about the chairs, the easiest way to rank them. That means that these terms: "comfort" and "discomfort" are so subjective and depends on people''s personality and tastes.\r\n	Third, if people do not pay attention in how they sit on, probably they have to cope with back pain problem and that lead on economical problems because they could spend money paying for medical care, consultation to special doctors, medications, and extra outcomes. Sometimes it is easy to explain where the pain is located. Nevertheless, back pain problems appear so many months later after the bad posture. For that reason. people need to look for information that allow them to choose a correct chair to sit on, no matters the place. Each individual has specific needs. \r\n	All in all, it is important to be aware of "how" people sit on instead of in "what" they will sit on. A correct posture can be defined as the way that the body can adapt to a chair without affect negatively the spin and the back. This posture is developed along all the life as a habit. Some studies have shown theories of "healthy postures" and terms of "comfort" but at the end people''s preferences play an important role to choose what is the appropiate chair to sit on. It is vital to know how to sit appropiately in order to avoid health, laboral, social and economic problems.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '00:02:43', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '0.00', '3.5', '3.5', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '16.0', 0, ''),

Changing from position to position, it was hard for them to find a perfect one to sit. There is a common knowledge however that sitting in an upright position with a straight back is the best way to sit. The problem is that this common knowledge was proven to be wrong. The following question has been then added to the latter problem: Is it the chair we are sitting on that makes us uncomfortable or is the way we chose to sit? There is no perfect chair for everyone to sit on nor there is a perfect position.\r\n	\r\n	While many people work for long hours it is important for them to know how to sit in order to find comfortability. As they are comfortable they are most likely to do a good job. That is why people have been wondering what was perfect for them, how to sit or what to sit on. For long, people thought that sitting straight was the best option simply because it seemed right and that it was approved by doctors as a "healthy" way of sitting (Fisher). However it is wrong to say that this position is perfect for everyone. First of all, the human body is made to be changing posiitons all the time because staying still provokes poor blood circulation and provides an unusual feeling of discomrfort in addition (Fisher). Then what is the perfect position to sit? There isn''t. As confortability may change depending on each individual''s feelings, the chair and the sitting possition are therefore both factors that can affect it. Since there isn''t a perfect positon, it would then be preferable that the sitter choses a chair he can sit on perfectly while changing positions. \r\n\r\n	On the other side, scientists have then been wondering if the true problem is really witihin the chair, with research they could make a chair that is adaptable to every position of the human body. We have for example the "Knoll ReGeneration" with materials made to instill comfortability to every sitter while being able to adapt any person''s way of sitting (Berlin). This chair is believed to be adaptable to everyone even if you are tall or short. For a chair to have that kind of technology it is then seen as expensive, not really if you can afford to buy it from 540$ with no arms to 676$ with arms (Berlin). This chair seems to be perfect at first but as we know that comfortability is affected by many things we have now the problem of the "preference". While this chair is adaptable to many positions, one individual may not like it simply because of its design, which is color or the way the chair is made. The sitter may also think that the chair is wether too low or too high, too wide or to smasll, that is has short arms or long ones, everything may instill disconfrotability in the sitter. There is therefore no perfect chair for everyone. \r\n\r\n	The question has been raised because many poeple want o find comfortability while sitting and working on their desks. There is no perfect chair nor there is a perfect position for everyone. We know that comfort is affected by every little details, from the way you sit to the chair''s design. Every single thing is crucial to it, the environement is also a factor that can affect it, the chair may not be perfect for a certain environment. It is then important to chose a chair that fits you and your surroundings while changing positions to find that confortability as there is no perfect way to sit nor there is a perfect chair for everyone.', '00:35:03', '3.0', '2.5', '2.5', '2.5', '2.5', '13.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '3.0', '15.0', '3.00', '2.75', '2.75', '2.75', '2.75', '14.00', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, 'it is important for them to know how to sit in order to find comfortability.

The biggest problem of spending most of our time sitting, is the position in which we do it, that for some is all about confort. Most of the times confort and posture are overlapsed, making some believe that a confortable position is indeed a good position to our posture. However it must be seen that the human body was designed to have a balance between, standing and sitting; therefore even if a confortable position is good to our posture, it will only be for a short time. For these reason, the time spent in a chair must be taken seriously, because long periods in a wrong position can mean serious problems in the future. Furthermore, it shall be argued that thesre is a need to see how we sit and for how long we do it.\r\n	First, some believe that a suitable chair can be the key to a healthier sitting, due to its advanced defaults, that elegedly allow a better sitting posture. In The Science of Stting, David Fisher, points out that during the 1884 the scientist Staffel theoris lead to what we can call, traditional sitting, where a staight back is physically desirable and social accepted. It is true that this position might be healthy, but only for a short time, because staying sitting with oyr back straight for big amounts of time might be everything, but is is not healthy. Furthermore, chairs are designed design is based upon what is regarded as a correct way of sitting. For this reason, chairs usually have a straight part desighed to keed its user in that desiered position, a consequence of the traditional way of sitting. Yet, it is knwn that there is a variety of correct posture, and all depend upom the individual characteristiscs. Therefore chair manufactures are creating diverse designes with the objective of giving to the user a better sitting position. \r\n	Second, the design used in many chairs, might be directed to a better sitting experience, but its price prohibitive makes it directed to a specific elite. in Sitting by Berlin James, the new desk chair, the Knoll ReGeneration is presented; furthermore being supported that the ergonomical features of the chair allow a better posture, a small environmental impact and a small price of 676$ or 540$ minimum deping on the model. It is obvious that these chair is a dead end, starting with the price that is ridiculously high, when compared with a normal worker sallary. Plus, the chair might be very good to our posture, but as mentioned above we were noy designed to be sitted all day, in fact every reputable source advise us to spend more time standing up and moving around than sitting (Berlin). Yet, it looks like that people are more concerned if thei are sitting in a golden chair, rather than the way they are sitting, with a proportion of 70-30 split between both. Furthermore chairs might have the most desirable technologie to enhace our postures, but the truth is that we cannot enhace oyr posture if we do not have one.\r\n	In addition, the bigest problem around this problem lay around the confusion that confort and disconfort are directly connected with a good sitting experience. For example, some would believe that we could spend all or day sitting in a chair that make us feel good, relaxed for instance, but not in a disconfortable chair that would have the opposite effect. But the fact is tha confort and disconfort are to different sides of the same coin: therefore we cannot link them directly with a healthy sitting. It is easy to a chair user to identify design flaws that make a chair disconfortable: however it do not mean that the absence of the same make the same confortable (Fisher). It is a fact that confort and disconfort are partly connected, and that both depend upon ones perspective, for these reason a chair cannot be designed to the masses, in other words in a large scale, because the customer loks for a combination betweem confort and propor sitting, which is unique for each individual. For these reason, an ergonimical chair (healthy chair) must be design specifically to one individual because one have different posture and confort requirement than some.\r\n	All in all, a prper sitting posture depends of the individual that we are talking about. Each individual have a different set of posture flaws that have to be take in consideration before designing a chair. However, a chair do not teach one to have a proper siiting posture, even less a chair. It is the individual that have to be concerned with his/her well being and look forward to hace a correct posture. Therfore, having a proper sitting is not a question of how ypu sit or in what you sit, it is a question of how and in what you sit. Because it is not correct to have a proper posture and sit in a chair that have the opposit effect, or sit in a proper chair and not have posture. Yet, it must be seen these combination is only effective as long as a helthy balnce between sitting and standing is seen.\r\n	', '00:44:45', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '1.0', '2.0', '1.5', '2.0', '6.5', '1.0', '2.0', '1.0', '2.0', '1.0', '7.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.50', '1.50', '1.50', '1.75', '1.50', '6.75', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', '0.0', 0, ''),

In an ancient time, People used to stand while they are working then "clerks had changed from standing at work to sitting, and most employees were females".( The Science of Sitting) It semms weired that people spent the whole day just standing and doing hard working.  They were anticipating that, however, " healty sitting is sitting upright".( The Science of Sitting) In my opinion I think that provide a good environment especially about the position and the way that people sit is important to achieve the success. I''d rather not staying or sitting all the day and sitting with a great furniture that makes me comfortable.\r\n	When we talk about the relationship between the body organs and the way that people use to sit is reasonable. It is healthy for people that they change the position in their workplace rather than sitting or standing all day." This is because the human body is adapted to change- to moving around but not to standing still or sitting still". ( The Sience of Sitting) In addirtion, staying for a while in one position either standing or sitting may causes proplems and diseaese and for sure it is inconvenience for them because "  Sitting or standing still for extended periods is uncomfortable and leads to many problems, such as poor blood circulation and too much fluid bulid- up in the lower legs". ( The Science of Sitting) People who sitting all day may suffer in their emotion so they will not do as much as they expected because " Is''s difficult to get excited abuot office chairs. Especiall now" ( Sitting In). Hence, keeping employees choose whatsoever for them is reasonable. \r\n	When we concentrat on the wya of sitting, the furniture is taking part. The featur of the chair provides convenience for the employees. Chairs should provide perfect options so the workers can set it up as they want and the movement will be easier for them. " Furniture should allow for body movments and various postures. For example, workers should be able to make adjustments to seat heigh and angle, backrest position".( The Science of Sitting) Knoll ReGeneration is a great example for new design. " the ReGeneration is lighter, more compact, and less expensive" (Sitting In) I think that we should get the desirable chaire no matter how much it is if it makes me relaxing. " a good chair is asound investment, and logic dictates you should buy the best chair you can afford". ( Sitting In) \r\nIn a nutshell, making a great environment of employees is significant so they can reach the dream that they have been looking for. Some people think that the chair is not a big issue. Convenience, however, is desirable. Nither sitting nor standing makes a great result in the future.

Well, comfort is what people are seeking for. The modren office has many factors that could help finding comfort such as; chairs and high technology equipments. However, some people are working in a standing workplace which means employees have to stand for many hours each day without taking a break and that could be harmful for them; It may leads to many problems such as poor blood circulation and back issues. I believe that what workers sit on and how they sit are two reletive things, both of them have the same importance because having a comfort chair without knowing how to set on it correctly could cause serious injuries.\r\n	On the other hand, Comfort is defined in feelings of well-being, safety and rest. Working all day long without finding comfort won''t give great results. Eventhough, sitting all time won''t be the best solution. So we can say that it''s a combnation between sitting and moving in order to find the comfort that we need because moving all time would be exhausting and sitting all time would build up fluid in the lower legs.
